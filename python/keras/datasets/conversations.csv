a girl i have been dating told me she has hpv are my risks any greater with her than the general population  we have not had sex i guess she had some warts and they have gone away without recurrence for at least 5 or so years  she is telling me it is no big deal given the stats i wonder if my risks any greater with her than the general population  i am in the process of divorcing and i logically know this will not be a lifelong thing with the new girl,most helpful answer you ask a great question and i am going to try to give you a great answer if only it were that simple first i think we should acknowledge your current girlfriend for informing you about her hpv diagnosis that is a very responsible and brave thing to do she is behaving the way every adult should act in this situation as to your risk for developing hpv if you have sexual contact with your girlfriend well it is difficult to provide a definitive answer human papillomavirus hpv can exist in the skin without manifesting as warts this means you can not always tell visually whether or not a person has hpv and you can contract the virus through skin to skin contact even in the absence of warts also a condom often does not protect against this contact because the hpv infected area of a woman is vulva may contact the portion of your penis or scrotum not covered by the condom all of that said hpv also can clear up on its own one study showed around 90 percent of female study participants showed no trace of the virus about two years after their initial diagnosis this means it is possible your girlfriend is body has cleared the virus on its own on the other hand the hpv virus can go dormant for years maybe your girlfriend is case is dormant not cleared to your question about is your risk of getting hpv higher with this woman than with the general population  the answer is yes if she is currently infected and no if she has cleared the virus keep in mind if you contract hpv from this girlfriend you risk transmitting the virus to another girlfriend down the road even if you use a condom as i am sure you know certain strains of hpv cause cervical cancer you should consider whether or not you want to be even remotely responsible for spreading this potentially life threatening virus clear as mud wishing you well

what are the side effects of weight loss pills,this question i have to tell you that is kind of one of those things that i guess asked all the time and i have to ask if they are taking the over the counter one which is alli or are they taking a prescription one some of the prescription ones work a little differently and it depends on the type of medication that they are on so as a pharmacist i am going to ask you to tell me which one you are on before i give you this type of information common side effects with some of the stimulant forms that are used to weight loss can include things like heart palpitations rises in blood pressure nausea dizziness constipation abdominal pain so you want to be really careful when patients are taking these to make sure they are not taking any other medications that they do not have any chronic conditions like high blood pressure or cardiovascular disease products like alli have more treatment effects which could include some fatty oils that will come out when they actually go in the bathroom they might experience some flatulence or gas we call them treatment effects but once again if they are just part of the medication doing its job it is actually helping you train to eat better and avoiding foods that are high in fat so just come and talk to me i will be more than happy to tell you what might happen to you if you have any additional questions we can always call your doctor and get you switched to something else

does secondhand smoke go through a machine that makes oxygen off room air is it dangerous to people with copd  i have emphysema and quit smoking 6+ years ago when diagnosed i was able to get off oxygen after leaving the hospital and manage to work three years ago i have moved to a building where the person on the other side of the wall is a heavy smoker since then i have become dependent on an oxygen machine could this second hand smoke be the cause of my decline over the past three years and does it get sucked through the oxygen machine,second hand smoke is tobacco smoke exhaled by a smoker and involuntarily breathed in by another person here are some 2nd hand smoke facts according to the national cancer society 鈥t least 69 chemicals produced by 2nd hand smoke are known to cause cancer 鈥2nd hand smoke does cause cancer in nonsmokers 鈥2nd hand smoke has also been associated with heart disease in adults and ear infections asthma sudden death syndrome in children 鈥2nd hand smoke has no safe exposure level i am not an expert on building structures or their air circulation systems and do not have technical details of your building is air circulation system with that said i will provide my understanding of the air quality in many office buildings occupied today and referred to as sick buildings these buildings may have poor air exchange systems filtering systems that are inadequate in size not adequately cleaned or otherwise properly maintained my own anecdotal accounting is that many of these types of building almost never receive fresh air as windows are only for the aesthetic purpose of providing natural light the windows are sometimes permanently fixed shut in effect the building occupants may be continually breathing the same polluted air irritations of the eyes ears and throats are frequent complaints of these building occupants due in part to chemical and environmental containments from indoor and outdoor sources in summary 鈥2nd hand smoke is dangerous it can cause cancer and other chronic health problems 鈥any office buildings today circulate unhealthy air 鈥 my conclusion is that your health problems at least in part may be due to the effects of 2nd hand smoke being breathed in while working in your office building

doc today did a pap test then asked me to do urine preg test few mins later she did a blood test why all the tests  i am on nortell 777 and have had a brown spotty discharge every 2weeks in the last 2 months last real period was in september since then been this brown stuff doc said it is old blood that hasnt fell out and she do not kno why she did not tell me the urine test results and said tomro she will tell me what is test results i do kno i asked her about a rh factor blood she said only if i am preg will she do the test but i overheard her tell the nurse to test for it,trying to guess another medical provider is rationale for doing tests is like predicting what my wife wants me to do on my day off impossible a blood test for pregnancy is considered to be more accurate in detecting pregnancy than a urine test so many providers will do a blood test as a back up i have no idea why your doctor would do any prenatal tests if you are not pregnant but an rh factor will not change so perhaps she is just adding it to the blood tests so that you can avoid getting stuck again just a guess your doctor is trying to determine why you are spotting so this is just the beginning of the diagnostic testing

can i get pregnant from precum while ovulating  i am having some symptoms but have not missed my period which should start tomorrow i am having cramps achy boobs increased mucous tightness round the lower part of my stomach some nausea i have been tracking my cycle n its predictable now so i usually just have cramps n that is it me n my friend always use the pull out method but this time i was ovulating n i feel odd with all these symptoms,hi here is a bit of info i found its interesting being it is about re cum can i get pregnant from pre cum pre cum or pre ejaculatory fluid to call it by it is correct name is a clear fluid that appears on the tip of the penis when a man has an erection and is sufficiently sexually excited it is a common misconception that this fluid is semen that has leaked out before the main ejaculation this is incorrect because this fluid is produced by something called the cowper gland and it is purpose is to flush out the penis before ejaculation so can you get pregnant from pre ejaculatory fluid pre cum well as this fluid does not contain sperm it can not by itself cause a pregnancy however as the purpose of this fluid is to flush out the penis it will bring any sperm left in the penis from the last ejaculation to the tip of the penis if this happens that small amount of sperm could cause a pregnancy if the man has urinated since his last ejaculation the urine would have flushed out and killed any left over sperm in the penis which means in this case a pregnancy would not happen the safest thing is to assume that an erect penis is always capable of causing a pregnancy even before an ejaculation so cover it with a condom before it comes in contact with the vagina good luck

my fiance and i have been having unprotected sex for the past two months or so could i be pregnant  i recently had a period that basically lasted only two days i been feeling different changes in my body and my fiance has been feeling nausea for the past couple of days could i be pregnant i have looked up symptoms of early pregnancy and i match more than half but i feel doubtful because of the bleeing,any time that you have unprotected sex you have the potential of becoming pregnant your body is designed to get pregnant so it is really only a matter of time assuming your fianc茅 is capable of fathering a child and you are ovulating clearly you are both wanting this to happen otherwise you would be using some form of contraception it is possible to have a period for a month or more even when you are pregnant so if you are having the signs start doing a home pregnancy test every week for a few time or have your medical provider order a more sensitive blood pregnancy test

how do you do kegel exercises,the first step in doing kegel exercises is to find the right muscles imagine that you are trying to stop yourself from passing gas squeeze the muscles you would use if you sense a pulling feeling those are the right muscles for pelvic exercises do not squeeze other muscles at the same time or hold your breath also be careful not to tighten your stomach leg or buttock muscles squeezing the wrong muscles can put more pressure on your bladder control muscles squeeze just the pelvic muscles pull in the pelvic muscles and hold for a count of three then relax for a count of three repeat but do not overdo it work up to three sets of 10 repeats start doing your pelvic muscle exercises lying down this position is the easiest for doing kegel exercises because the muscles then do not need to work against gravity when your muscles get stronger do your exercises sitting or standing working against gravity is like adding more weight be patient do not give up it takes just five minutes three times a day your bladder control may not improve for three to six weeks although most people notice an improvement after a few weeks

say something happens and i cannot make my cobra fee and i lose my coverage after the open enrollment date if i then apply for health insurance on the marketplace would this be considered a hardship to get the application processed i am currently covered by anthem blue cross with a ppo when i had the option to apply for insurance during the interim period of time after losing my job i was denied coverage at kaiser for a pre existing condition if i apply for a kaiser plan now during open enrollment will i be accepted,if you apply now you must be accepted for a plan that begins january 1 2014 starting then insurers can no longer deny people coverage because of a pre existing health condition and i would suggest you shop now for a new plan because you will likely find something less expensive than cobra if cobra expires outside of open enrollment you would be able to sign up for a new plan but that will not be the case if you just stop paying for it and while there are hardship exemptions in your situation you would need to meet very specific eligibility requirements set by your state is marketplace

how many bathroom trips in a day are considered frequent urination  30 year old overweight woman concerned about diateties no other noticeable symptoms,this is an excellent question and i am glad you asked it it is also kind of a hard question to answer everyone is bathroom habits are different usually when we talk about frequent urination  we mean more frequently than is normal for you  but because type 2 diabetes specifically is a disease that can come on gradually you may not notice that your urinary frequency has increased if you are urinating every hour that probably would generally be considered frequent  if your urine has a sort of sweet smell that is another telltale sign of potential diabetes the only way to know for sure if you have type 2 diabetes is to get some lab work done do not be afraid to know the truth untreated diabetes can have long term health consequences it is better to find out early and seek early treatment than to go along in denial and damage your kidneys or lose your eyesight i would suggest you make an appointment with your primary care provider he or she can help you not only determine whether or not you have diabetes but also discuss ways you can take control of your overall health and well being wishing you all the best
help progesterone level 12 95 in 7 weeks pregnancy i am on week 7 of pregnancy in recent blood work my progesterone level is 12 95 and i am on medication for that my doctor feels that this level is low did anyone have this similar situation and carry on to have successful pregnancy because i am really scared,hi and from newkidscentre com from week 7 to 14 during this time the placenta will also start to produce progesterone and will start to replace the ovaries as the main source of progesterone this will cause the progesterone levels in the body to plateau though they will start to rise again at the end of the first trimester it is common to see progesterone levels around 15 60ngml but those experiencing a multiple pregnancy will have higher levels the body will use this hormone to relax the muscles so your body can manage your growing baby more easily this will also help to prevent contractions too early in your pregnancy very high levels of progesterone might cause hemorrhoids indigestion heartburn or constipation furthermore progesterone in different trimesters can vary from at a range of as follows first t rimester  9 47ngml second trimester  17 147 ngml third t rimester  55 200 ngml so your about 2 points off i do not think its that much to worry over but a test next week may show a new higher reading just where you want it tom be hope this helps you good luck

what is a homa calculation,homa calculation is a good adjunct to a1c and glucose testing in folks with type 2 diabete prediabetes or risk of diabetes due to family history or obesity i believe more endocrinologists and other clinicians caring for such patients will use the homa calculator more routinely in the future not to diagnose diabetes but rather to gain insight into the relative contributions of beta cell dysfunction and insulin resistance in folks with elevated a1c i suspect homa can be used to spot people at risk for diabetes sooner than current screening tests fasting glucose or a1c however the appropriateness of this test for screening and perhaps for diagosis would need to be studied scientifically in the meantime i believe it is a useful clinical tool under the right circumstances  pancreatic beta cell function can be roughly estimated by measuring fasting insulin and glucose simultaneously ask your doctor for these blood tests then using [a] homa calculator to assess the estimated beta cell activity and insulin resistance  homa stands for homeostasis model assessment the general concept is that the higher your insulin resistance due to excess body fat genetics or other causes the harder your beta cells need to work to produce enough insulin to keep the glucose levels normal someone with lots of insulin resistance say twice as much 200 of a normal healthy person will have to have lots of beta cell activity 150 or 200 just to compensate over many years of excess beta cell activity over 100 activity then in some individuals the beta cell activity will start to peter out as reflected by lower insulin levels or inappropriately non elevated insulin levels in the face of mildly elevated glucose and the calculator will indicate there is only around 50 beta cell activity the a1c does not start to go up into the prediabetic range a1c 6 0 6 4 until the beta cell activity is around 60 50 beta cell activity in the 40 or less range is what we see in type 2 diabetes if we measured insulin and glucose and used the homa calculator in seemingly normal patients with moderate to high risk of eventual type 2 diabetes  such as patients with parents or siblings with type 2 or in patients wiith obesity then we could probably clarify the diabetes risk even sooner we would not have to wait until beta cell function is 60 we could spot it when it is at 80 etc and monitor it i think this is a concept scientists should explore further as a potential component of a national diabetes preventionreversal strategy 
my son will not let me clean out his ears and they look really dirty what should i do he is 2 12 almost 3,you only need to clean with a wash cloth what you can see the use of q tips is not needed or necessary earwax cerumen while it may have a disagreeable appearance is not dirt it is a protective wax coating for the ear canal just the way wax protects fine wood furniture or your car using cotton tip swabs can actually make things worse by pushing wax back into the ear canal and there is always the potential of them causing eardrum damage so your little boy is correct by not letting you dig in his ears do not clean out his ears but you do need to carefully wash off the wax drainage that you can see

what is cryptitis is this associated with colitis,cryptitis is a term that is used to describe one of the abnormalities that is seen under the microscope when tissue from the small intestinal or colon is examined the crypts are normal tubular structures composed of cells that extend into the walls of the intestines these crypts contain the cells that give rise to all of the other cells that migrate out of the crypts and then line the inner surface of the intestines inflammation of the crypts is known as cryptitis cryptitis is seen in inflammatory bowel disease both crohn is and ulcerative colitis but it also can be seen in other inflammatory conditions of the intestines it is not a disease itself but a microscopical manifestation of several different diseases cryptitis also may refer to inflammation in the anus two centimeters from the anal orifice anus the lining tissue of the anus begins to change into the specialized lining of the colon this junction is called the pectinate line at the pectinate line are small mounds of tissue that protrude into the anus between these protrusions into the anus are small out pouchings from the anus and into the surrounding tissues these out pouchings are the anal crypts although they are covered with flaps of anal lining tissue the anal crypts communicate with the anus and colon above inflammation of the crypts probably caused by the trauma of passing stool andor infection is referred to as cryptitis if infection progresses it can extend further into the surrounding tissues and lead to the formation of an abscess or fistula
my sister was diagnosed with acute neutrophilia is this a form of leukemia,on the face of it the answer is no  acute neutrophilia is not leukemia but let me explain further neutrophilia is the medical term for an abundance of normal white blood cells in the system acute simply means the high blood cell count is a short term or temporary event neutrophilia is often called a high white cell count  usually a high white cell count indicates the individual is body is responding to an infection since that is the primary role of white blood cells in the system however any type of inflammation can raise the white cell count including a heart attack or a bad burn in leukemia the bone marrow produces an overabundance of abnormal white cells called leukemia cells these cells are not normal white cells and do not act like normal white cells for example leukemia cells do not fight bacterial infections the way normal white blood cells do if you and your sister are concerned about her diagnosis your best bet is to have a discussion with her health care provider about what her diagnosis means and what may have caused her white blood cell count to go up if this is garden variety neutrophilia the chances are her white count will normalize gradually i hope this helps

how do i handle my 7 year old son that not only thinks he is fat only 44 lbs but also thinks that he is ugly,first if you have not already tried to objectively talk to him about his height for weight match start there at 7 maybe showing him a growth chart check on the cdc gov website and plotting his height weight bmi <link> and show him where he fits relative to the healthiest zones for bmi between 5 85iles is the lowest risk second maybe there is some teasing going on at school or in the neighborhood that is giving him this inaccurate body image societal and cultural pressures beyond the schoolyard and neighborhood might be at play as well media messages about physical appearance are everywhere and are capable of influencing kids this young we sure do not want the heathy eating and activity message to turn into an unhealthy drive for thinness lastly could there be something more maybe if you can not seem to make any headway on changing your son is concerns about himself then maybe a check up with your doctor can be a way to see if there is something more

if you do not have copd but the er thinks you do and treat you accordingly can that adversly affect your breathing  mom had an infarcted bowl took days for them to find it i told the er she had copd although she had no trouble breathing on her own except for one incident and was at that time diagnosed w copd she never took oxygen or any breathing aids after the diagnosis but since she was diagnosed i told the er when she died they put the 1st cause of death as breathing failure septic shock infarcted bowl and heart failure i think were in there as 2nd and 3rd ,i have dealt with copd issues with my grandmothers almost my whole life the only things i can think of that your body would adversely be affected by are steroids and oxygen if they put you on steroids for your lungs and you do not actually have copd that is not a good thing they put my grandmother on prednisone which is a steroid anyway steroids like this can become an issue for you especially if you do not need them because your body becomes dependent on it oxygen is also something that your body will become dependent on if they put you on a portable oxygen machine or if they had you put one in your home and you use it constantly your lungs will become dependent on that extra oxygen and after so long your body will not be able to go without it this happened to both of my grandmothers and they both claimed that they felt better before they got on the oxygen than they did with it because they could not do anything with out it

neck pain left arm pain hot flashes that make me sick to my stomach what is wrong with me i am scared when i get sick to my stomach i either have diarrhea or i vomit i also feel as if i am going to pass out my heart rate accelerates and this has been going on for over a week and i do not have the money to go see a doctor but i am so scared to go to sleep at night i am afraid i might not wake up,your age is needed to appropriately feel out a possible diagnose however my best guess is that you are experiencing symptoms from two or more problems the neck and left arm pain could be a bulging disc at the c7 vertebrae which i too have recently experienced chiropractor adjustments with following massages successfully relieved the numbness and pain in my arm the neck pain still exist but could be related to the arthritis which has developed from my injuries be careful to to seek treatment a s a p because without treatment the spine normally worsens if you experience extreme pain nausea can develop but diarrhea is not related diarrhea could possibly come from a case of irritable bowel syndrome ibs or polyps in the colon change of diet will drastically improve your symptom is hot flashes normally result from the loss of the hormone estrogen it begins to depreciate in the body during menopause with your heart racing vomiting and fear i am reminded of anxiety or panic attacks deep breathing meditation will improve anxiety and problems with vision could be related to the spine blood pressure or the need for glasses because of age if you are middle age see a doctor but get use to these type problems for your body is beginning it is shut down process worrying does not help it is only making things worse for you get the sleep your body needs and make sure your water intake is appropriate sleep is very important as is water try to keep your spine in the natural position while sleeping seek out free clinics state or government help someone that you know may have the answer for you believe for yourself healing and it will come

planning to have a baby should i have sex everyday on my wife is fertile days my semen vol drops below 2ml if everyday my semen volume is usually 2 5 ml if the gap between two ejaculations is 2 days or more bu if it occurs everyday it drops below 2 ml which im afraid that it might be low for conception also only the first spurt of semen is thin with a white tint but the rest of the ejaculate looks normal,pregnancy is really about numbers one of your wife is eggs available for fertilization at the time of ovulation and a few hundred million of your sperm waiting around for that egg to emerge the odd are really in favor of fertilization in most cases having sex everyday is just fine you do not really have to wait and store up a volume of semen the bulk of an ejaculation is not sperm but semen from the prostate gland the more sperm that is ready and waiting the better the color or consistency is not something you should worry about the semen really needs to be where you can not see it if you know what i mean assuming everything is in order the frequency that you have sex the volume of your semen will not be a major factor in achieving a successful pregnancy but you do have to have sex so get off of the computer and go for it

can the appendix grow back  i have had my appendix removed back in 1989 i have had several scans ultrasounds over the past few years that have indicated my appendix looked good how can that be if it was removed is it possible it has grown back,well that is quite interesting is not it the appendix is not an organ capable of growing back in fact the appendix is not an organ at all it is an anatomical structure a tubelike sac that hangs off the large intestine where that structure meets the small intestine doctors and scientists are still debating what function if any the appendix performs so to your question first i would ask if you are positive your appendix was removed in other words was it taken out due to a case of appendicitis or was it removed in conjunction with another operation sometimes for example a surgeon will remove the appendix at the same time the gallbladder or an ovary is removed if that is the case maybe you were misinformed about whether it really was removed or not if you are positive the appendix was removed then i would say someone is misreading the ultrasound image it is possible they are seeing some fleshy tissue or fatty tissue and identifying it as the appendix hope this helps
which cosmetic filler is best for me,the most commonly used fillers are made out of hyaluronic acid because of their varying consistency they are used differently prevelle silk is the thinnest of the hyaluronic acid fillers it gives a soft subtle effect that is very natural it is my personal favorite for treating the area around the lips the effects usually last 3 to 4months juvederm is slightly thicker it works well on marionette lines that just beginning to show smile lines and to smooth the contours of jaws that are beginning to sag juvederm usually lasts around 6 8 months although in the lips it does not last as long because the constant movement of the mouth breaks down the filler restylane is one of the older fillers around while many doctors still use it i personally prefer to use juvederm or perlane because i find they give smoother results perlane is the thickest of the hyaluronic acid fillers it is best for deep folds like really pronounced marionette lines or the creases that run down from the nose and around the mouth this is the one people start asking for once they hit forty it lasts for about a year perlane does tend to leave the skin slightly swollen for a couple of days so plan accordingly ifyou have a big event coming up radiesse is a totally different filler in the first place it is made out of calcium it has a firmer consistency which makes it ideal to model cheekbones or jawlines or to fill in very deep marionette lines the problem some doctors have with radiesse is that because it takes so long to dissolve 鈥 up to a year in most cases 鈥 it is very hard to correct mistakes unsatisfactory radiesse results however are there to stay for the next 12 months

why do i still get morning coughs a year after quitting smoking no phlem wakes me up at night night and morning only,good for you for quitting smoking that is a true achievement to be proud of in terms of the persistent cough one year later that is a good question and i would advise you to take it up with your primary care provider physician nurse practitioner or physician assistant several possible explanations for the coughing come to mind first depending on how long you smoked you may have permanently damaged your lungs which results in their inability to clear mucus although you are not coughing up any phlegm it could still be residing down there in your lungs and triggering a coughing response second smoking damages more than just the lungs again depending on how long and how much you smoked you may have damaged your heart muscle if the heart cannot contract with enough force to move blood through the lungs properly it causes congestion to occur this congestion can cause a dry hacking cough   especially when you are lying down i think you definitely should see your health care provider for an exam the cause of the cough may be highly treatable if caught in time best wishes to you
is there any otc medications that can be taken for severe itching caused by primary biliary cirrhosis that really works  my insurance company is trying to deny my dr  is recommended treatment by not covering the prescription medication that he gave me they recommended me to take zyrtek over the counter instead i have been trying benadryl and everything else like that in the over the counter stuff already it has not been effective for me and i am miserable the name of the medicine i was prescribed is atarax and it could have even been filled in generic form my pharmacist told me that it is not even expensive,you need to first check to see if the medication is on your formulary or list of drugs your insurer does cover even if it is however insurers can require you to try a less expensive drug first to see if it works if it does not    and that sounds like that is the case here    your doctor should then contact your insurer to provide information as to why you need the medication he initially prescribed and how efforts to treat you with over the counter medications have failed if that does not work you can officially appeal your insurer is decision in an effort to have the medication covered you are entitled to at least two levels of appeals and your insurer is required to provide you with information about how to engage in that process

do i still have kidney stones  i had surgery 2 months ago to remove 2 stones and a stent im still in a lot of pain in the same area as before my urine seems to be clear although after i urinate i find blood on the toliet tissue but not in the urine i have also noticed some tissue in my urine im in alot of pain an need answers please,this is an issue that only your urologist can or should answer anytime that you see blood in the toilet it can only be from about two sources the urine or the bowels since you recently had surgery for kidney stones you are likely to form more so another ct scan of the kidney may be in your future especially since you are in pain even tiny kidneys stones can cause severe pain if they are lodge in the ureter so it would be best not to ignore these symptoms and consult your urologist if you cannot see your urologist quickly then an emergency room visit is appropriate they will most likely order an immediate ct scan of the kidney with your history and symptoms i have been there and done that stent and all so my heart goes out to you it feels as if it is trying to pass my stone in the last 3  in my ureter when attempting to squeeze out the last amount of urine it hurt a bit and some blood came out is this normal during the passing process

how to maintain weight with light exercise i recently lost 30 pounds through eating about 1360 calories a day and exercising lightly or moderately for 30 minutes each day i want to increase my caloric intake to avoid losing more weight but to lose remaining stomach fat is my activity level adequate enough to maintain weight with higher calories eaten per day  i am an 18 year old female and have not previously been active and my schooling prevents me from being able to do longer workouts,its as easy as stepping into a swiimming pool  water no higher than shoulder blades but 1st pick up 2 cheap starfoam blocks that is velcrowed around your ankles as you just walk around and maybe a small ball you can push in front as you walk this takes the gravity out of getting a good workout i say you will be up to 40 min 3 4 day a week i have had 3 back surgeries ending in nerve damage and it was the only thing that gave me great work out and didnt injur me 4 star advice good luck

how can i use fresh cranberries,鈥榯is the season i love that this is the time of year for one of the most powerful antioxidants we can eat the great news for us is that in november and december most grocery stores carry fresh and organic cranberries the age old jelly out of a can that is traditionally served at thanksgiving does not hold a candle to the different varieties of things you can do with fresh ingredients whole cranberries are extremely tart so you will need to sweeten them i usually use agave nectar but you can use brown sugar honey or regular sugar depending on the amount in the morning you can add some frozen or fresh whole berries into a smoothie for a tart and unusual flavor blend with strawberry blueberries or raspberries these berries are also excellent to add to a high fiber muffin  take the fresh cranberries into lunch and dinner by using as a spread on a turkey sandwich or served with grilled chicken a simple cooked sauce made with juice and zest of an orange agave nectar and cranberries can be chilled and served with brie cheese for an appetizer another great use for fresh cranberries is baked in a dessert with apples or pears the combination of color texture and taste is fantastic again you may have to add a tablespoon of extra agave or sugar to balance out the tartness of the cranberry one of my favorite and more unusual recipes made with fresh cranberries is my cranberry balsamic and mint relish this takes only minutes to make in your food processor you put fresh cranberries orange zest brown sugar fresh ginger mint and balsamic vinegar pulse it and store for up to one week this mix is great on your holiday buffet for turkey but it is also a surprisingly delicious mix for a holiday martini  so the next time you are at the store take a walk through the produce aisle for a few extra seconds and pick yourself up this antioxidant treat

what types of crowns are available,permanent crowns can be made from all metal porcelain fused to metal all resin or all ceramic metals used in crowns include gold alloy other alloys for example palladium or a base metal alloy for example nickel or chromium compared with other crown types less tooth structure needs to be removed with metal crowns and tooth wear to opposing teeth is kept to a minimum metal crowns withstand biting and chewing forces well and probably last the longest in terms of wear down also metal crowns rarely chip or break the metallic color is the main drawback metal crowns are a good choice for out of sight molars porcelain fused to metal dental crowns can be color matched to your adjacent teeth unlike the metallic crowns however more wearing to the opposing teeth occurs with this crown type compared with metal or resin crowns the crown is porcelain portion can also chip or break off next to all ceramic crowns porcelain fused to metal crowns look most like normal teeth however sometimes the metal underlying the crown is porcelain can show through as a dark line especially at the gum line and even more so if your gums recede these crowns can be a good choice for front or back teeth all resin dental crowns are less expensive than other crown types however they wear down over time and are more prone to fractures than porcelain fused to metal crowns all ceramic or all porcelain dental crowns provide the best natural color match than any other crown type and may be more suitable for people with metal allergies however they are not as strong as porcelain fused to metal crowns and they wear down opposing teeth a little more than metal or resin crowns all ceramic crowns are a good choice for front teeth temporary versus permanent temporary crowns can be made in your dentist is office whereas permanent crowns are made in a dental laboratory temporary crowns are made of acrylic or stainless steel and can be used as a temporary restoration until a permanent crown is constructed by the dental laboratory

what temperature is considered a fever for cancer chemotherapy patients,if you have a temperature of 100 4潞f or higher for more than 1 hour or a one time temperature of 101潞f or higher this should be considered an emergency you should call your doctor right away even if it is in the middle of the night it is important for you to remember though that even if you do not have a fever but just are not feeling well you should call your doctor right away no matter the time of day www preventcancerinfections org is an excellent resource to learn more about the risk of getting an infection during your chemotherapy
how concerned should i be about a blood sugar level of 335 about 2 hours after dinner  i am 57 yrs old female had gastric bypass 5 12 yrs ago and have had pretty good control since cutting back on my meds and getting regular exercise but have slacked off and have eaten too much sweets lately i have had what felt like a urinary tract infection then a yeast infection the last several days i took the meds for the infections and still felt genital discomfort so i finally thought to check my blood sugar i waited about 2 hours after dinner and got a 335 i do not check often,what is most concerning is that you do not check your blood sugars often it is possible that an infection could increase your sugars but you need to stay on top of it i suggest making an appointment with your doctor to get lab work done including an hemoglobin a1c this will give you an idea of what your average blood sugars have been over the past few months then you will want to be more vigilant with diet and checking your blood sugar anyone who has had gastric bypass should receive regular follow up yearly to deal with the challenges of maintaining weight loss and checking for deficiencies such as vitamin b12 iron and vitamin d i would make an appointment with you gastric bypass doctor for follow up if you have not already take care of yourself

how can i manage having difficulty sleeping during pregnancy,finding a comfortable resting position can become difficult later in pregnancy recommendations do not take sleep medication try drinking warm milk at bedtime try taking a warm shower or bath before bedtime use extra pillows for support while sleeping lying on your side place a pillow under your head abdomen behind your back and between your knees to prevent muscle strain and help you get the rest you need you will probably feel better lying on your left side this improves circulation of blood throughout your body
scared of the smallest heights  i feel like i can not breath and my whole body shakes this has happened in the last year or so an example is tonight i had to change my smoke detector batteries and stand on a chair i could not do it i live in a house with a loft and i have never been upstairs,a good psychologist therapist or psychiatrist can help you overcome this fear using a variety of techniques this can be fixed
is toe twitching numbness in hand and weak arms a sign of ms  my three toes beside my big toe on my left foot twitch at random times and it only lasts a couple of minutes but no matter what i do i cant stop it this happens a few times a month also my right hand goes numb at least 4 or 5 times a day i have noticed the past month or so that my arms are becomming so extremely weak i can barely change my 2 year old is clothes anymore becaue my arms get so weak and my muscles in my arms hurt there is probably a rational explination for all of these symptoms right,yes i am sure there is a rational explanation for this the problem is you will not get that explanation unless you see a medical professional for a physical exam before i jumped to a conclusion of multiple sclerosis ms i would think in terms of less scary explanations like a problem with a disc in your neck that might account for the arm weakness muscle twitching can be caused by several things including a mild potassium deficiency is the toe twitching related to the arm weakness maybe maybe not your primary health care provider is in the best position to start putting all the pieces of this puzzle together because he or she knows your medical history current medications and supplements and so on i would suggest you call and make an appointment to get the ball rolling toward a diagnosis meanwhile i would not get too worried about this being something scary like ms we will both hope it is something easily explained and easily treated wishing you all the best
how do you know when to take a two year old in to doctors that has a fever and a cough  he has had a fever all day ranging from 100 2 103 4 at its peak today he also has a cough,you need to involve his medical provider if you are unclear as to the cause of the symptoms or their significance for instance if a child has a history of asthma or pneumonia they need medical intervention sooner than a child who does not have this history if your two year old had flu vaccine this year he is less likely to get influenza if not he may need to be seen early since influenza can be treated in the first two days so his medical history plays a huge role as well as your comfort in dealing with his fever and cough when in doubt seek medical help
what could have happened to my elbow  ok recently i was changing brakes on a car and i was laying on the ground trying to get a bolt of with a socket wrench i was pulling as hard as i could when it finally gave all the momentum and force went and i slammed my elbow right under my tricep above where the elbow joints if that makes any sense it hurt so bad its been a couple days and i have full control and it extends but it is sore sometimes and i get an occasional pop or squish noise when it extends what could this possibly be,oh ouch the perils of car repair right well several things could be going on here the only way to tell for sure is to visit the doctor for a physical exam and possibly an x ray despite the fact you can move the elbow ok it is still possible there is a bone fracture in there or a bone chip that is worst case scenario it is also possible you sustained soft tissue damage at the bottom of the triceps muscle where it connects to the elbow joint is a tendon called the triceps brachii tendon  you may have torn or strained this also the ulnar nerve is located in the area you injured if you are experiencing tingling in your pinky finger you may have damaged this nerve of course there are several ligaments in the elbow that could have been injured as well if rest does not resolve your pain and any other symptoms within a few days it would be worth getting checked out by a doctor the elbow is a complex joint and you do not want to risk long term damage by trying to wait out what could be a treatable injury best of luck to you

i recently starting taking cymbalta for anxiety and every time i stand my head throbs like when your sick is this okay  i have only been taking cymbalta for two days now immediately i felt this problem though the day that i received the medicine i took it about mid day later that evening is when i began to feel the head throbbing as i stood i was on lexapro and i didnt have this side effect before that i tried celexa and had the same problem its a throbbing pounding that last for a few seconds the same way your head pounds when your sick and you stand up should i go back to the doctor or wait it out,it is possible that this is just a temporary side effect as your body adjusts to the new drug i would probably take a few more doses and go from there i recently started zoloft for anxiety along with my klonopin which i have been on for 2 years and i have had no side effects after 5 days none of the typical gastrointestinal nausea etc however cymbalta is an snri and zoloft is an ssri i am not sure but i do believe that snris can come with more side effects you may want to ask your doctor why an snri was chosen

a stray cat urinated on my lap and i am very worried since it is around and might have touched my vagina what do i do  i was feeding a stray cat and after finishing it sat on my lap i then realised that it urinated i do not know what to do and i get paranoid very easily i am worried about any infectious diseases that i might get should i be worried is it dangerous,the only thing you really need to do is shower and you do not even need to overdo the shower just apply some soapy water and rinse thoroughly it is highly unlikely you would get any sort of infectious disease from a cat urinating on you maybe if you ingested the urine or something but not from simply getting it on your skin it is not even likely you would catch something if the urine contacted your vulva so take a deep breath and jump in the shower you will be fine wishing you well

should we be concerned our son is ears are always full of fluid  since my son was about 7 weeks old we have been fighting never ending ear infections well since the weather has finally warmed up the ear infections have basically gone away unfortunately every time since then we have been to the doctor most recently for pink eye each of them has said he has fluid in his ears but no infection we saw an ent when he was four months old about tubes but the ent thought he might still be a little too young at the time should we revisit getting tubes,persistent fluid in the ears longer than three months may be an indication for tubes since this can interfere with hearing predispose to frequent middle ear infection and delay speech development please follow up with the ent on a regular basis to monitor this stagnant fluid and make sure your son appears to be hearing normally turning toward your voice or sounds etc

my friend is 23 years old recently he started suffering from hardhips breathing and a sting like feeling below his heart but this only occurs at night and it is getting worse should he be afraid of potential heart attacks or not and what are the possible causes please thank you very much,a cardiac cause for chest discomfort and pain should be ruled out primarily one should have a very low threshold for it a baseline ekg should be done just to be on the safe side based on your description its unlikely to be a cardiac cause if the chest pain is involving chest wall tenderness then costochondritis is the likely cause and would only require nsaids like ibuprofen for treatment wishing you best of health thanks
bad smelling discharge urine very bad smelling and dark headaches no balance sleeping alottired no energy i took 1500 mg of penicillin a day for 10 days most symptoms went away now have mild oder and pasty discharge i miscarried about a yr ago and did not seek any medical care could something be wrong due to the miscarriage,hi the penicillin could have upset your vaginal natural balance it will do that because of this you may now have bv bacterial vaginosis its just one of these things some women can get can be just the once or can keep re occurring so its either of to your doctor for a test and meds or an stdgum clinic they will do the same thing your ok its not an std but the clinic will help you or you can google bv and sea salt bv and boric acid bv and garlic these are just some ways you can find natural help now it could be this that is chucking the rest of your body out of sync and giving you the tiredness as for your miscarriage perhaps a d&c would have helped but you could still have it done now try seeing a doctor or going to a baby clinic that has a doctor there do hope this helps good luck
i had sex with my boyfriend friday night but he pulled out but got sperm on my underwear can i get pregnant from that,most helpful answer it is unlikely that you would get pregnant from the ejaculation just on your underwear but you can get pregnant from the leakage of semen before ejaculation as you were having unprotected vaginal sex if you are engaging in this type of risky sexual practices you need to be on an effective contraceptive and your boyfriend must use a condom or it is only a matter of time until you are pregnant did you get pregnant this time i do not know but you should take a pregnancy test if you miss your period or start having any signs of pregnancy if you do not get pregnant from this careless act out of sheer luck please use this stressful experience as a lesson and do not do this again hi janette if you play with fire you will get burnt yes well if you have sex with a guy without any kind of bc then at sometime you will get pregnant and that is even if he pulls out as there is a good chance that he could have sperm in his pre cum all you can do now is wait to see if you get your next period if its a missed one you do a hpt on your first missed day but you cant get pregnant from sperm on your underwear you will have to see how things span out if your not pregnant then get some kind of bc and you should always carry condoms may not what he wants but safer than bare back riding why did you not think of plan b on saturday would have got rid of your worries do hope there is some help here good luck there may be the possibility that you are pregnant make sure to take some pill abogados madrid abogados en madrid abogados madrid [url=<link> madrid[url]

i had a large injection of penicillin for strep 2 days later my lymph nodes have swollen substantially is this normal  tuesday afternoon i started feeling sick sore throat cough body aches fatigue headache thursday it felt so bad i went to the er they glanced at my throat declared it to be strep shot me full of steroids painkillers and penicillin then sent me on my way i began to feel better that day and yesterday felt mostly normal except for a persistent productive cough and weak voice but as of this morning my lymph nodes are absurdly swollen and very tender possible explanations,those glances that pronounce a strep diagnosis really bug me i hate those treat em and street em medical encounters a strep test is so easy so fast so why not get an accurate definitive diagnosis before treating anyone with antibiotics and steroids most sore throats are viral not strep and one of those viruses ebv causes mononucleosis mono giving antibiotics to someone with undiagnosed mono is worthless and can actually make things worse a mono test is easy to do as well but apparently the er medical provider did not want to take those extra steps lymph nodes normally enlarge in response to infection or inflammation in their neighborhood so strep if you really had it respiratory viruses and mono can all cause lymph node enlargements viruses even mono self resolve over time and do not respond to antibiotics if you did have strep the penicillin injection painful  would have taken care of it if you do not get better see your regular medical provider and insist on a careful thorough examination for mono and a few diagnostic lab tests
how should a senior who has had a stroke cerebral infarction alter his or her diet,most strokes are due to a blood clot in the brain which is essentially the same thing that causes a heart attack for this type of stroke we would recommend the same changes in the diet as those recommended to people with heart disease if your cholesterol is high you need to take the necessary steps to lower it that means decreasing your saturated fat intake found mostly in meat and high fat animal products like whole milk you also want to decrease fat intake overall by cutting back on desserts butter creamy sauces etc and losing weight when needed can play a large role in bringing your cholesterol down many people who have suffered from a stroke need medication to get their cholesterol down and to prevent future strokes but diet changes are still very important even for people taking medication exercise can also help prevent another stroke but make sure to check with your doctor to find the right type of exercise for you

what are the symptoms of congestive heart failure,the symptoms of congestive heart failure vary among individuals according to the particular organ systems involved and depending on the degree to which the rest of the body has compensated for the heart muscle weakness an early symptom of congestive heart failure is fatigue while fatigue is a sensitive indicator of possible underlying congestive heart failure it is obviously a nonspecific symptom that may be caused by many other conditions the person is ability to exercise may also diminish patients may not even sense this decrease and they may subconsciously reduce their activities to accommodate this limitation as the body becomes overloaded with fluid from congestive heart failure swelling edema of the ankles and legs or abdomen may be noticed this can be referred to as right sided heart failure as failure of the right sided heart chambers to pump venous blood to the lungs to acquire oxygen results in buildup of this fluid in gravity dependent areas such as in the legs the most common cause of this is longstanding failure of the left heart which may lead to secondary failure of the right heart right sided heart failure can also be caused by severe lung disease referred to as cor pulmonale or by intrinsic disease of the right heart muscle less common in addition fluid may accumulate in the lungs thereby causing shortness of breath particularly during exercise and when lying flat in some instances patients are awakened at night gasping for air some may be unable to sleep unless sitting upright the extra fluid in the body may cause increased urination particularly at night accumulation of fluid in the liver and intestines may cause nausea abdominal pain and decreased appetite

can fainting be a symptom of pink eye our 6 yr old fainted and the pedi thinks it is due to pink eyeear infection she was staying the night with grandparents her grandfather says she fainted she describes it as she fell asleep standing up and when she woke up her ears were making a really loud noise the other symptoms were swelling around her eye eye pain crusting around her eye ear pain and complaints of headache on and off several weeks prior her pedi talked on the phone with her grandpa and then called in an antibiotic does this seem like a correct dx should we get a 2nd opinion,i have been seeing kids for over 40 years and i cannot recall one incident where a child fainted from pink eye or even an ear infection as a matter of fact it is pretty rare for a six year old to faint period so yes i think your little girl deserves a thorough examination to find a reason i just can not buy the pink eyeear infection theory sorry like you i am a bit skeptical i do not know anything about your little girl or have the ability to examine her so i do not really have any wild guesses as to why she fainted or if this was a seizure but i do feel she deserves a work up i would suggest a pediatric neurologist

can you use lasers to treat varicose veins,lasers are often used to treat varicose veins however it depends on what we are talking about so a lot of people come in and tell me they have varicose veins but they have the little spider veins so for the larger veins that are true varicose veins the big blue ones that can kind of course down the legs that tend to be more genetic those ones are sometimes treated with lasers but those lasers are more within the vein and are done either by a certain type of dermatologist who specializes in that or a vascular surgeon the lasers that we use on the surface of a skin really treat them more superficial very small types of pinkish or bluish veins not the larger ones i find that if i can get a needle into a vessel sclerotherapy which is injecting a sclerosing something that will irritate that vessel lining will help eliminate that vein much better than a laser would but once we have only the little remnants those tiny little vessels left behind then lasers work very well i also only use lasers on the ankles i do not like to inject or do sclerotherapy on the ankles because i think that it is much safer and more effective to use lasers in that area

i had a one night stand with protection is it likely that i have contracted an std  i recently went through a bad breakup which caused me to have a little too much to drink this past weekend long story short i ended up sleeping with someone i barely knew there was protected vaginal sex and unprotected oral sex which she engaged in on me involved i know for a fact that this girl had sex with someone else two months prior to me and that i had no std beforehand i have no signs or symptoms of an std how likely is it that i contracted an std from this encounter,sorry to hear about the breakup that is always rough well if the girl who performed oral sex on you did not have any active cold sores  herpes simplex type 1 virus  and you used a condom for the vaginal sex then the risks of your getting an std from this encounter are relatively low the risk is never non existent because a condom may not cover all skin areas that could contact an area infected with human papillomavirus hpv  for example but in general it sounds like your risk is pretty low the only way to know for sure is to ask your partner if she has any known stds awkward right but you know you could approach it from the standpoint of hey i know we were both a little drunk and i just wanted to assure you i do not have any stds that you might have picked up she likely will respond kindly to your reaching out and may offer the same information in return by the way kudos for remembering the condom after drinking too much
after losing 50 pounds i have gained back 10 and always feel hungry what food can help suppress my appetite,if you want to feel satisfied and kill carb cravings at the same time then head on over to lean protein that means low fat dairy poultry fish and beans you can also buy whey protein powder at any whole foods gnc or vitamin shoppe i like to combine vanilla powder with skim milk and frozen berries for a protein shake    two scoops of protein equals 20 grams which is very satisfying you are probably not eating enough protein most people overeat carbs especially ones filled with refined sugars refined sugars white sugars increase your insulin levels through the ceiling and then they come crashing down stimulating a major appetite for more sugar it is a vicious cycle you want to avoid stick with lots of non starchy veggies and healthy fats like olive oil and nuts just watch out for what i call bingeables    foods that feel addictive to you and you can not seem to have just one and if you have one you will end up eating a mountain of them finally try to eat a balance of healthy protein carb and fat roughly every 3 4 hours beginning with breakfast that will help to quell your hunger and appetite as well

does amoxicillin alter your menstral cycle and does it interfere with my birth control pills i went to urgent care and diagnosed was with an ear infection and really bad congestion they prescribed amoxicillin to me but i did not think to ask if it would interfere with my birth control but my concern is that the day i started my antibiotic was the day my period was suppose to start i typically do not start right on sunday more like monday night but its now friday and i have not started i am suppose to start my new pill pack this coming sunday should i be worried or is their an answer,this is an excellent question because there is a lot of outdated information circulating about the effect of antibiotics on the effectiveness of birth control pills let me start with your first question i am not aware of any studies that show amoxicillin affects the menstrual cycle in any way however you will find a lot women claiming on internet forums that their period was delayed when they took amoxicillin this does not mean it is true many things including illness can affect your cycle if you take amoxicillin and experience a delayed period in the future then you will have a good idea of whether or not this medication affects you in this way to your second question women for decades have been advised to use secondary back up birth control if they take antibiotics while on birth control pills this is prudent advice however today it is thought only two specific antibiotics rifampin and rifabutin may actually decrease the effectiveness of birth control pills so the amoxicillin should not affect your hormonal birth control but if you want extra peace of mind then use a condom until after you have finished the antibiotics if you believe you may be pregnant you should take an at home pregnancy test if the test is negative then you should be ok to start your next pack of birth control pills on schedule whether or not your period arrived if the pregnancy test is positive then obviously you should not take birth control pills but you should see a doctor to begin prenatal care wishing you well

i have spider veins and varicose veins on my legs as a result of pregnancy and age will lasers really zap those,depending on how small they are lasers can be very effective in treating spider veins i do not recommend lasers to the external surface of the skin for treating varicose veins there are some lasers that are done within the skin by actually cutting into the vein and eliminating it that way and those are done by specialized dermatologist or vascular surgeons but lasers on the surface can be effective for the very small spider veins i have found though that for most spider veins sclerotherapy which is in injecting a specific ingredient that helps eliminate those veins works much better than lasers once you have the smallest vessels left behind laser then works very well also for varicose veins or the spider veins on the ankles i find laser as a treatment of choice in that area

two red painless and unraised blotches on my penis tip  yesterday i masturbated cleaned myself clean with a wet wipe an hour later i went to the toilet and saw a red blotch on the tip of penis just to the right it is a brightish red about the size of a small pea it is not painful or itchy this morning i inspected more closely and found another much much smaller one although its possible i missed it before it is not as std as i have not had sex in over a year however i am eager to resolve this problem as i am dating and it is not very pretty,unfortunately your description of a red painless flat blotch on your penis is not sufficient to make a definitive diagnosis let alone offer treatment suggestions this could be balanitis you can look this up but this is just a blind guess since there is no way to examine you over the internet if this condition does not self resolve in a few days you will need to seek a hands on medical examination

why am i having stinky white thick vaginal discharge around the time of my period without any burning or itching  i am taking an oral contraceptive the generic form of seasonique so i have a period every 3 months after the first month when i would normally have my period i am plagued with this horribly smelly thick white vaginal discharge without any burning or itching i talked to my doctor and she said it was my birth control and i need to start taking something else before i had this information i kept getting antiboitics and antifungals should i keep taking them for my problem until i swap bc,a thick white vaginal discharge without a smell is normal hormonal levels affect the amount and color of your vaginal discharge since birth control pills contain hormones it is natural that they will affect your vaginal discharge some birth control pills contain higher levels of estrogen and some are progesterone only without estrogen if the discharge is bothersome it may be advisable to change to a different type of birth control the concern with your discharge is that it smells this could be a sign of an infection you should see your gynecologist about your discharge and discuss whether it is a sign of infection and whether another birth control pill would be better for you the estrogen in birth control pills lowers the acidity of secretions in your vagina and increases your risk of yeast infections a vaginal yeast infection usually causes a sore itchy vagina with a thick clumpy white discharge that has no odor and looks a little like cottage cheese as long as a vaginal discharge is not associated with pain itching discoloration or a bad odor it can be a positive effect a vaginal discharge helps lubricate the vagina for intercourse in women who are not on birth control vaginal discharge can indicate whether or not ovulation is occurring during ovulation women have an abundant clear wet and stretchy discharge many women compare the discharge at ovulation to raw egg whites

how can i tell if my child has head lice and what do they look like,head lice are really uncomfortable to see i think most parents go through this at some point with their kids going to school and the only way to find it is to really look very closely at your child is scalp so in school it is very hard for these children not to have contact with each other share brushes hats scarves and that is really how it is spread so as much as possible if you can instruct your kid not to share these products with their friends that would be a great start and a great way to prevent it but beyond that you just have to examine your child is scalp very closely what you will typically find rather than the active lice is nits what nits look like they really look like flakes of dandruff except that when you try to remove it it will not come off the hair because what the lice do the nits are the eggs from the lice that will hatch within a week or so so what the lice do is they create this little capsule and they glue it to the hair and that is how it sticks so it is very hard to take it off the problem is i have parents come in and they say well but my child would shampoo their scalp everyday and that makes it worse because when the hair is that clean the glue sticks better so you are almost better off having a greasy scalp because it is harder for that nit to stick to the scalp so it is not a matter of cleanliness at all but once those nits are attached to the scalp you really have to get a prescription treatment to help get rid of it there is a prescription called ovide that you put on to the scalp leave it on for a few hours and then shampoo it out and repeat it in a week to get rid of any nits that might have hatched by then

i have high blood pressure what cold remedies can i take,this is a great question well when patients come to me at the pharmacy i always have to ask them a few other questions like what are their symptoms what they may think is a cold i may think it is different so i try to find out what is going on do they really have a stuffy nose is it just a cough based on that i can pick the appropriate products to help them feel better the physician may recommend for them to use a product like sudafed or sudafed pe and that is okay but once again the physician or healthcare provider makes that recommendation and as long as they are testing their blood pressure at home i would say to them if you are taking this medicine start using your diary again make sure it does not go up the minute you see your blood pressure go up you need to discontinue it there is a product called coricidin hbp which is actually made for people with high blood pressure but it does not have any nasal decongestant in it so if you have a stuffy nose usually either i say to them you could try using like a vaporizer or you can use a saline spray those do not contain any drugs so they are okay to use in people with high blood pressure

why does my neurologist do that,one thing i have realized over the last few years   we neurologists do all these things during our examination of a patient and we almost never explain what we are doing so i thought i would post some explanation of what we are doing when we look in your eyes or tickle your feet eye examination  watch my finger is a test to look at how the eye muscles move the eye and lets me evaluate how the nerves that move these muscles work the cranial nerves 3 4 and 6 we also look for abnormal eye movements that can be seen in some diseases we look at how the pupil works another reflex which is controlled by the brainstem we also look into the eye  the retina at the back of the eye is living nerve tissue and we can actually look at it and observe its health face we ask you to smile to watch how the facial muscles controlled by the facial nerve cranial nerve 7 work and make sure both sides move the same way sometimes we ask patients to close your eye to look at the same nerve function stick out your tongue and say ahh lets us look at cranial nerve 12 tongue muscles and the muscles in the back of the throat your family md is often just looking for a sore throat muscles neurologists do a lot of tests for muscle strength in the arms and legs we are looking for any signs of weakness in the muscles the pattern of which muscles are weak helps us tell how well the brain spinal cord and nerves are working for example   if the weakness is one arm and leg on the same side we worry mostly about a brain problem like stroke these is the part of the examination where we ask the patient to squeeze our hands make a muscle stand on there toes etc balance we often ask patients to do some crazy sounding things while standing or walking like stand on one foot with your eyes closed or walk on your heels now on your toes these are all tests of balance and coordination and help us understand how part of the brain is working some diseases of the brain mainly affect balance and coordination and some things like alcohol do as well which is why the police borrowed that part of the neurologic examination to use on the roadside reflexes about half of my patients giggle when i tap their knee and make their leg twitch this is a normal muscle reflex and tells me a lot about the health of the nerves in the leg and the back we can get the same reflex by tapping on the back of the ankle achilles tendon or the inside of the elbow biceps tendon or the back of the elbow triceps tendon the tickling of the foot is actually supposed to be scrapping something

im 29 295 lbs working out 5 days a week what calorie intake should i be at to lose weight  i started working out and eating better about 3 months ago when i was 315lbs but for the last three weeks i havent lost any weight at all i work out 5 days a week now eliptical some days with row and running then weight training do i need to push myself further in the gym i feel like from eating once a day and not working out to now working out 5 days a week and eating healthier more meals and spreading it out i should be seeing more results,it is estimated that 3 500 calories is the theoretical amount necessary to lose 1 pound of fat to put this in perspective you will need to create a deficit of 500 calories per day to lose 1 pound per week again theoretically this deficit can come from either eating less expending calories through exercise or a combination of both a healthy weight loss rate is 1 to 2 pounds per week or 10 of your body weight over the course of 6 months a common mistake that people make is to not continually recalculate their calorie needs keep in mind that as you lose weight you will need to readjust your calorie intake accordingly do not go below 1 200 calories per day however without medical supervision if you hit a plateau and are not seeing weight loss adjust your calorie intake or be more stringent with eating healthier changes in the gym that can help break through a plateau include 鈥 increasing the amount of time you spend per exercise session 鈥 increasing the number of days per week you exercise 鈥 increasing the intensity level of the exercise 鈥 changing the type of exercise altogether it is always best to consult with your doctor or a registered dietitian when making changes to your diet or beginning an exercise routine there are lots of websites and phone apps available to help you calculate your calorie needs and to use for foodexercise journaling though i recommend the food and fitness planner on webmd available here <link> before undergoing any drastic weight loss program i am assuming that you would eventually like to lose over a hundred pounds it would be best to see your medical provider some baseline lab work can be important with that said the amount of calorie restriction would depend on how fast you would like to lose that weight a good weight loss would be about two pound per week that would add up to nearly a hundred pounds in a year a reasonable and achievable goal at this point find out what you are eating now the number of calories determined by a honest food diary for a week reduce those calories by about a 1000 a day i am guessing but i suspect you are ingesting well over 2500 to 3000 calories a day right now based on your weight and the fact that it appears to be stable keep exercising this is very important and i am so proud that you are doing it the body does not give up weight easily but if you are consistently eating less than your body needs to maintain weight your weight will drop and continue to drop until you stop dieting it may not drop every day or every week but at the end of each month you should be considerably less than the weight you started with at the first of the month if not something is amiss so you may need to see
i have no medical insurance am i eligible for a free mammogram and if so how and where,well the provisions about the preventive care really deal with insurance plans that are in the market so what the affordable care act did was say starting with plan years jan 1 2011 from that point on as plans are renewed individuals will no longer pay a co pay for everything from getting their kids immunizations to having mammograms or cancer screenings because we really want to encourage people to get checkups in advance to get situations identified which may cause serious health problems and get them found in a case where someone has no health insurance at all the best possibility really is to find the nearest community health center and community health centers are throughout the country talking to her health department about where is the closest community health center community health centers are being expanded through the affordable care act but they are community based providers of primary care and preventive care who deal with individuals who have full insurance who have partial insurance and people who have no insurance coverage at all everything from cancer screenings often there is dental care available and checkups for kids it is very high quality low cost care and that would be the best option

is oatmeal good for diabetes,i personally have never liked the taste or texture of oatmeal this is unexpected because i like the taste of almost all foods i have ever tried oatmeal tastes ok to me only if it is loaded with brown sugar and cinnamon etc i love the taste of cold cereal and i would eat if every day for breakfast if i could justify it but i can not because of the carbohydrate load the very high fiber cereals seem more reasonable to me but i would rather eat other things personally professionally i generally try to steer my patients away from oatmeal and high fiber cereals during the period of time that they are trying to lose weight and reduce their a1c i do steer them toward other breakfast options such as low fat cottage cheese fruit greek yogurt light yogurt lean breakfast meats canadian bacon turkey ham etc  soy sausages eggs especially egg whites and homemade protein shakes 100 calories of protein powder plus 100 calories from milk almond milk or fruit we bring back the oatmeal and high fiber cereals once they are in maintenance mode i believe i am in the minority when it comes to my views on oatmeal and high fiber cereal however my concern is the high carbohydrate load i am suspicious of whole grains and believe they interfere with weight loss and a1c reduction unless the dietary fat intake is very low in which case i encourge eating these foods the instant oatmeal is pretty highly processed in order to get it to cook so quickly i believe the research supporting oatmeal consumption is suspect there are clearly much worse foods one could eat but there are better ones too i am a type 2 diabetic myself and love oats however the doctor is right about highly processed cereals their are far better grains to eat if you like oatmeal try cooking steel cut oats they are almost totally unprocessed and the gi is lower another thing you do not have to load your oatmeal with sugars or sweeteners to enhance the taste simply add stevia and if you like brown sugar add 12 tsp unsulphered molasses with the stevia the most important thing to keep oats from spiking your blood sugars is to eat a good fat or protein with it such as almond butter or even whey powder this stops the spike cold also do not eat a fruit at the same time as the startchy carbs this accelorates the spike instead eat a fruit as soon as you get up and the carbs oats at least 12 to1 hr later if you do not have this time skip the fruit till snack time between breakfast and lunch this works for me very well eating this way raises my blood sugar around 20_35 points total on my post meal check without the protein or fat and fruit at the same time the sugars would be 75_150 higher i enjoy otameal

peculiar rash on the underside of my penis i already went to the doctor and tested negative for gonorrhea and chlamydia i have no idea what this is the dots popped up a week after my doctors visit i am scared what is this  <link>,op here they are not moles a day before they were tiny bubbles the dots are now scabbed over
what are these fluid filled lumps around my anus  i had anal sex with my boyfriend a week ago both sexually clean as checked by doctor and no other sexual partners & the other day above my anus in the crack started itching & the day after i developed a cluster of pus like fluid filled small lumps above my anus and in the crack these are itchy & painful <negative_smiley> im freaking out because all the research i have done say its genital herpes is there anything else this could be i used a lot a massage oil as lube also any information would be great,i am sorry to hear you are going through this the only way to properly diagnose this is by physical examination so i suggest you make an appointment with your gynecologist or primary care provider to have these lesions looked at while it is true these lumps could be a symptom of genital herpes they might be caused by something else altogether there are actually a few different conditions that could cause this type of outbreak that is why a physical exam is required i wanted to note that getting a clean bill of sexual health from a medical professional is not entirely reliable unless you had the appropriate lab work done the herpes simplex 2 virus hsv 2 that causes genital herpes for example can be undetectable by physical examination if you are not having an outbreak at the time in that case it would only be detectable by a blood test so it is possible for a person to have hsv 2 and not even know it i wish you all the best and hope you get a diagnosis soon meanwhile you should avoid having sex in order not to transmit this if indeed it is a sexually transmitted disease

do over the counter lip plumping products really work,most lip plumpers work as a local irritant these 鈥減lumpers鈥 contain ingredients that might cause temporary swelling such as peppermint oil peppers and menthoxypropanediol a potent derivative of menthol unfortunately there are not many scientific or multi institutional studies to demonstrate the long term efficacy of lip plumpers if you are looking for a slight temporary plumping of the lips for a special evening out you may be satisfied with the results you get from these cosmetic lip plumpers if your lips are thin and you are looking for that bee stung look you will likely be disappointed use of a lip plumper combined with cosmetic techniques that add the illusion of fuller lips such as using a lip liner slightly outside the natural line of the lips may provide a more satisfying illusion of fullness or you can always play up one of your better features such as your eyes to draw attention away from your thin lips <link> <link>

our 7 year old is adult teeth are coming in but are brownish compared to his baby teeth what could be happening,adult teeth are typically darker than baby teeth and that is normal if the teeth are brown your child might have had high fever at about age 3 and was given antibiotics tetracycline this is the result i am assuming that the oral hygiene is good and that the color is not surface stain it is commonly called tetracycline staining  there is nothing to do at this time you must consult with your pediatric dentist first and foremost make sure that this is the correct diagnosis when the teeth finally erupt bleaching can be successful at times many times adults end up with porcelain laminate veneers to cover the staining however the best thing to do is nothing any dental work has a life span and an untouched tooth is always better for the long term health the darker color in itself is not a problem physically just esthetically please go see a pediatric dentist to confirm the proper diagnosis for your child

i smoked cigs for 1 month averaging about 3 a day just wondering if any irreversible was done i did quit since then i started smoking for a month after a period of depression a couple of months ago 2 3 cigs most days with a couple more on bad days i would estimate i probably had 4 packs total over the period i went cold turkey as i started to get my life together and hated the ill feeling from them i exercise regularly and eat healthy and i am still young i would just like to clear my head and hear that i did no damage permanent to my lungs i know it takes a bit to recover hopefully to 100,good for you for making the sensible decision not to rely on cigarettes for stress control it is much better to learn good coping techniques than to self medicate the good news is you probably did not irreversibly harm your lungs by smoking lightly for a month even heavier smokers can undo the damage to their lungs to a certain extent by quitting if you are young and you maintain a smoke free lifestyle you should do just fine i hope this sets your mind at ease

my husband currently has shingles how can i prevent myself and 2 year old from getting it,my husband had shingles and both my daughters got chicken pox the incubation period is 14 to 21 days from the time they first are exposed he had them on his chest and they did not come in contact with that part of him but they got them anyway i think exposure is more than touching the scabs evidently but the old saying that if you get them once you will not get them again is only true with chicken pox if a person is susceptible and exposed and their resistance is low they will get shingles if exposed to them or if their body will not fight it off some people opt for a shot that i am not sure of the name of it but if a person gets it within a certain amount of time after the recover from the shingles they are less likely to get them again but they say it is quite expensive so just being in the same house and touching things the person with shingles has touched will cause a child to contact the chicken pox as it is of the same virus

how do we maximize our chances of becoming pregnant,for most couples becoming pregnant occurs naturally some couples have difficulty conceiving and ways to maximize chances of conception become important other parents may want to time the delivery of their babies during particular times of the year or space the birth of their babies according to a desired schedule the first step in maximizing the chances of conception is by estimating the time of ovulation ovulation is that time of the menstrual cycle wherein the egg is released from the ovary and travels towards the fallopian tube in women with regular menstrual cycles ovulation usually occurs 12 14 days prior to the onset of the next menstrual flow simply counting back fourteen days from the expected date of the onset of next period should be the time of ovulation the couple should have intercourse for several days before day of and day after the expected time of ovulation there is usually some variation in the time of ovulation even in women with regular cycles so a few extra days of intercourse before and after expected ovulation is advised if the cycles are irregular and unpredictable estimating the time of ovulation becomes difficult and professional assistance may be helpful another option for a woman with irregular cycles is the use of ovulation predictor kits available over the counter at most drug and grocery stores these kits can be used to determine the approximate time of ovulation by detecting urinary hormone elevations that precede ovulation another approach is to have intercourse every other day throughout the menstrual cycle this approach will take out the stress or anxiety involved in timing intercourse basal body temperature timing is a technique of checking the body temperature every morning and charting the results if the temperature rises by a certain amount and stays elevated it can be assumed that ovulation occurred difficulties with this method are that it is tedious and only provides the woman with information about ovulation after it has occurred ultrasound images of the ovaries can be performed to monitor the growth and collapse of the ovarian follicle during the cycle the follicle is the fluid filled structure that surrounds the egg and it can easily be seen on ultrasound this method is probably the most accurate in timing ovulation it is also the most expensive and is usually reserved for selected couples who are experiencing difficulty in becoming pregnant it is important to remember that even though intercourse and ovulation coincide pregnancy may still not be achieved in any given menstrual cycle or even after several consecutive menstrual cycles in many situations the failure to conceive after multiple attempts is not a reason for alarm it is not uncommon for pregnancy to occur only after several months of consistent attempts couples who have experienced an inability to conceive after several cycles may consider seeking professional advice to determine if an infertility evaluation is necessary

i have acne excoriee i would like to stop sqeezing my acne what is the alternative does a ripe white acne heal unpopped,white filled acne will eventually heal itself unpopped but whatever you do do not pop acne that is not ripe or white as scarring will result i used to have a similar problem with acne in middle and high school years and have been prescribed creams to medication but none truly worked i then researched online and noticed a lot of acne comes from the food that you eat and deficiencies in zinc and vitamin a and c i went to a local cvs and purchased zinc tablets which helps in reducing oil levels from a range of 35 100mg a day be careful as overdose can occur with excessive amounts i also began eating carrots and foods with vitamin c which can be googled if scarring happens you should invest in apple cider vinegar and apply to a cotton ball and place on scar for a couple of minutes before the shower which helps removing old skin layers and making new ones that has helped my scars tremendously after 1 2 months then in the shower i recommend a body wash that has vitamin e in it for a good clean moisturizer which will help your skin as well it all starts with the diet and cutting all the greasy oily food fight your acne from the inside then out and you will see the results hope this helps

what type of therapist should i see  i am 4 months pregnant with my first child the day after i told my husband he told me to leave i am living with my parents i had to stop working & have no money i have been battling binge eating disorder since high school now i am 36 in 16 weeks i have gained 25 8 pounds i hate myself i went from binging 5 times a month while eating healthy all the other times and going to the gym 4 times a week to not leaving the house crying daily and binging 4 days week,i am so sorry to hear about your situation and you are wise to see a therapist the fact that you are pregnant complicates your management however so you will need to see a therapist that is skilled in dealing with people who have eating disorders you may need a coordinated team to get you safely through your pregnancy and beyond including a obgyn who fully understands your struggles a nutritionist to carefully monitor your intake and perhaps a psychiatrist yes this care costs money but since you are not working and do not have financial resources you will likely qualify for public assistance with your medical needs as you may know taking certain medications during pregnancy is usually contraindicated but a psychiatrist can help weigh those risks and benefits my heart really goes out to you and i hope you will start the ball rolling and get some help as soon as you can

can an asthma attack be triggered by traveling from high altitude to a low altitude destination  my 6 year old son traveled with his father from colorado to north carolina for a vacation he has a history of mild asthma with only one previous attack a year ago accompanied by a cold he did not have any symptoms of a cold when he left and no trouble breathing 45 minutes after arriving in north carolina he had a severe asthma attack and was treated by airport paramedics with two albuteral nebulizer treatments could this be caused by going from one climate to another,most definitely i have worked in the field of respiratory therapy for 35 years anyone who suffers from asthma must be very careful when traveling from lower altitudes to higher altitudes the difference in temperatures alone can trigger an asthma attack not to mention the humidity humidity in lower elevations is much thicker that in higher elevations before traveling next time ask you doctor to give you a prescription for inhalers which consist of xopenex and atrovent the xopenex is quick acting for acute attacks while the atrovent is a longer lasting maintanence medication which wards off attacks you may also consider traveling with a nebulizer that can be used in a car acdcbattery or anywhere for that matter also when exercising in higher elevations always remember to monitor you breathing you may want to also invest in a small pulse oximeter which can be purchsed at pharmacies home care stores or the internet hope this information helps you

what is your opinion of thermage,well thermage is indeed an fda approved procedure that super heats the skin and specifically the collagen which is one of the main building blocks of skin and theoretically would form new younger and tighter collagen now that process does not take place over night and so the manufacturer has advised physicians and secondarily patients that they will not see an immediate result the hoped for result may take 4 or 5 or 6 months to achieve that process is probably not achieved the success that we had hoped it might again by observation because the patients have to accept that when they are employing a new technology we are all learning about it so the first kid on the block may be satisfied and may be disappointed i think to this point we are a little bit disappointed now that said there have not been any complications i think most patients consider the significant complication to have hit their wallet because they did not get much for their money and it is not inexpensive it can be several thousand dollars because it means a visit in the operating room the doctor is time the technical the cost of the technology so again not harmful but not really delivering the goods certainly not a substitute for a surgical facelift and many services technologies kind of position themselves as less invasive less traumatic less expensive less everything quote facelift but the answer is they can not match the proven record of a surgical procedure it is just not possible by having the skin treated by a beam of light to get rid of a saggy chin and jowls and the product of many years of ages and perhaps even some dissipation

i have a skin rash that looks like ringworm but is not its red and very itchy and spreading everywhere what can i do  my breakout started with one bump on my thigh then a day later there were two on my upper body then all of a sudden the next week my whole upper body was covered in red raised and itchy bumps i am into my second week with this and it is spreading to my face all over my arms and moving down my legs i am not in pain but it is hard to deal with being itchy everywhere i do not have any other symptoms if there was a way to know what i have just anything to help thank you,unfortunately without the ability to actually see this skin eruption that you are describing it would be very difficult if not impossible to blindly offer an accurate diagnosis a diagnosis is really essential when it comes to treatment knowing your medical history will also help solve this mystery rash based solely on your description this could be an allergic reaction perhaps urticaria hives hives are intensely itchy comes on suddenly and if the allergen is still in your midst it can continue to persistspread regardless of the cause which can be very challenging to find the itchiness can be treated with an antihistamine like diphenhydramine benadryl or other over the counter medications in this class seeing a medical provider is important since many things can mimic hives this sounds like pitariasis rosea which usually spreads to the trunk of the body bathe in selson blue it could be from a plant or some kind of poison oak that you wer not aware of may be in your yard some body is house or being out in the woods you have the same thing almost like i have going on with me but mine is on my right inner thigh itchy raised dry rash i am just using over the counter anti itch cream good luck

does taking coumadin in lead to thyroid problems,you ask a really interesting question i am going to try to give a brief overview of the curious interaction between anticoagulant drugs like warfarin coumadin and the thyroid for reasons that remain unclear elevated thyroid activity increases the effect of certain oral anticoagulant drugs let is use the inaccurate term blood thinner to illustrate this concept if you are taking warfarin your blood gets thinner  if your thyroid gland also starts cranking out higher levels of hormones or if you increase your dosage of thyroid pills then your blood will become even thinner this can have negative consequences because we obviously do not want a person is blood to be too thin  blood that is too anticoagulated can ooze out of the blood vessels into surrounding tissue like the brain not good however it is probably an overstatement to say that using warfarin can cause thyroid issues i do not believe this is the case but you would be better off to ask an endocrinologist if you are taking warfarin your doctor may want to monitor your thyroid levels some docs do not think the thyroid effect on anticoagulants is a big deal at all while others might be more concerned if you have questions about this you definitely should ask your doctor for an explanation wishing you well

my mother has type 2 diabetes she lost 30 pounds and watched her blood sugar until recently how can i address this,i wish i had something useful to suggest some method of convincing a loved one to shed unhealthy habits and pick up good ones it is such a common situation    when we care deeply for someone who is putting their own health in jeopardy almost eveyone experiences some form of this during their lifetime parents worry about their teenagers putting themselves in risky situations children of alcoholics or smokers family members who do not take care of themselves we wonder if their unhealthy habits will lead to serious illness or death that will take them from us prematurely or cause problems that we have to deal with or put us in a position of having to look back with regret that we should have done something to cause them to change we have heard stories or seen movies where someone is behavior takes a turn for the better after an emotional conversation either a pep talk or a crying session or a stern lecture etc sometimes it actually works in real life other times it just gets awkward or backfires in my experience it usually backfires or leads to hurt feelings and resentment however at least we can look back and convince ourselves we tried my advice is to try for one of these intense conversations when the timing seems right then you can at least live with yourself without wondering if you should have done something differently tell her how it makes you feel and how it might impact you if she has a stroke or heart attack or goes blind or she ends up on dialysis or loses a foot because of her actions learn how it makes her feel to have diabetes and to have to choose between the sacrifices of doing nothing and allowing her disease to progress vs the sacrifices of making changes that are difficult and reduce the few sources of pleasure she might get in a typical day you are both in a tough spot i hope you can work together to find a way to move forward in a positive way

can i take benadryl with zyrtec my wife has hives on her chest and arms that just poped up last night,if the hives do not clear up fairly quickly or if they are accompanied by difficulty breathing your wife should seek immediate medical attention these can be the signs of a severe allergic reaction to something    food medication etc if your wife gets hives occasionally as some people do and they are not accompanied by other symptoms then i would suggest she speak to her doctor about getting a prescription specifically for the hives there are medications other than benadryl that are used to treat hives in terms of combining antihistamines i would suggest you speak to a pharmacist while benadryl diphenhydramine has a different chemical composition than zyrtec cetirizine they still are both the same class of medication generally we try not to combine medications of the same class unless specifically directed to do so by a physician i hope that gives you some clarity

do home laser hair removal systems really work they are not cheap are they as good as professional laser hair removal,the home systems for hair removal are somewhat effective but they are not as effective as in office treatments i often recommend them for my patients to do for any remaining hair after having a full leg done for example or other areas so they are not fda approved for the face so you should not use them on the face it would not be great to do a whole leg it would just take too long and too many treatments over time for smaller areas if you have the patience for it it is fine to do some of them actually have sensors that can tell if your skin is too dark and they will not work so you have to know what system you are getting you should have it evaluated by your dermatologist to make sure that you have the right skin type and that it is the right system for you and then again it is really great for smaller areas or for touch up after having laser hair removal done by your dermatologist

went to the doctors had xrays done on my back doctors said nothing is wrong with me but back hurts worse i went to the doctors for my upper and lower back pain and i was put on a profile that restricted my physical work load then three months later i felt better due to not having as much physical work load so went back to doctors and they took me off profile which i didnt have a problem with but now the pain is back and it is worse than before they did x rays on me before and told me nothing was wrong i do not know what to do now and something has to be wrong for me to be in this kind of pain,i am sorry you are going through this few things hurt as much as back pain just to clarify x rays look for injuries of the bone and surrounding tissue in other words an x ray of your back could provide a preliminary indication of a fractured vertebra or a herniated disk in your case the x ray showed no injuries of this type which is great news back pain is not always caused by injury to the spine or spinal nerves in fact a major source of back pain is actually muscle spasm back spasms can cause very severe pain i suspect this may be what you are experiencing if the pain went away when you were on light duty and then returned when you went back to your regular duties it may indicate you are not using correct body mechanics you should pay close attention to your posture as you lift and bend always avoid bending and twisting as the spine is not made to accommodate this type of movement you also may benefit from back exercises these exercises combined with stretching can strengthen your back muscles and make them more supple this will help alleviate back pain from overuse and do not forget your core core training strengthening your abdominal muscles helps relieve back pain and improves posture if the pain continues go back to the doctor and ask about physical therapy to help you strengthen your back and core as a last resort you might consider anti spasmodic medications however those can make you drowsy and have other side effects wishing you well

can poison ivy rash return same place after 2 months  rash returned same places on arms after 2 months since had first rash  have not been any where near any plants no pets to come in contact with poison ivy any one ever hear of this happening,poison ivy or oak is caused by exposure to the olioresin oil of the plant it does not come back in the same place two months later unless you were re exposed to the oil again the oil can remain stable on an object for years so you do not have to come in contact with plant just an object that still has the oil on it please be sure you actually have poison ivy many skin eruptions can mimic this allergic disorder and some can even show up in the same place like eczema shingles etc  so i see that some people insist poison ivy cannot return months later and others say it can and who is right absolutely the people who say it can return are right last summer i had poison ivy around my ankles many months later in the winter a milder version of the rash returned i was not wearing the same clothes not sleeping on the same sheets and not touching anything i had used outdoors i was not working outdoors at all moreover even now a year later though i do not have the rash around my ankles if i scratch my skin in that area the red bumps and the itching will return currently i am recovering from poison ivy rash primarily on my face and neck  unrelated to last year is episode i have taken prednizone for a week and never again will i take a stereoid no wonder all those nfl players are killing people i have washed all my clothes sheets etc in hot water twice the rash on my face has almost disappeared but i have little outbreaks here and there in odd places like a bump on my arm or on my back but i have not worked outdoors in more than 2 weeks the poison ivy  as someone else said  is surely in my system i wish i could prove it so that people like me tormented by this vicious plant would not look for answers and receive erroneous ones from so called professionals what has worked better for me than anything is white vinegar it stings on the bumps and openings in the skin but the stinging is not worse than the itching i apply it liberally with drenched cottonballs until my skin is dripping and i wait for it to dry naturally then i rub itch all over the now dry area there may be better methods but the vinegar dries it out makes thick scabs hideous but effective the scabs fall off fairly soon so thick they make a plopping sound when they fall ugh gross  i have been able to sleep with this method maybe having to get up once in the night to reapply the vinegar or just grope for the itch and rub some in  whereas last year using other treatments i could not sleep other treatments  vick is vapo rub clorox so

can a stroke just affect the legs and nothing elsse,that is a good question a stroke is what we call the death of small portions of brain tissue due to an interruption of oxygen delivery common causes of stroke include a blood clot which prevents the flow of oxygen rich blood to an area of the brain or a hemorrhage basically a burst blood vessel in the brain usually the symptoms of stroke such as weakness only affect one side of the body not both so if your question is can stroke cause weakness in both legs and nothing else  then the answer is probably not because a stroke does not usually affect both sides of the body at the same time if your question is can stroke cause weakness is one leg and no other body parts on that side  the answer again is probably not  usually a stroke causes weakness to the entire side of the body from the face to the toes everyone should know the symptoms of stroke because stroke is an emergency that requires prompt treatment if you ever suspect someone is having a stroke do these three things ask them to give you a big big grin and hold it does one side of the mouth droop if so this is a sign of stroke ask them to extend both arms out at shoulder height and hold them is the person able to raise both arms equally if not this can be a sign of stroke ask them to answer a simple question such as what do you see out the window  or what did you eat for lunch  if the person can not give you a coherent answer if their words do not go together correctly this can be a sign of stroke if the person you are testing for stroke does not pass two of the above tests call 911 immediately when it comes to stroke better safe than sorry hope this helps yes woke up one morning and fell for leg gave out upon standing waited a few hours before going to er for left leg and foot was very heavy and numb cat scan showed i had stroke found out after many more tests that right corotid artery was totally blocked left leg and foot still numb and heavy

my sinus is blocked on the left side of my face how dod i get this to drain without having surgery ct scan shows alot of junk on the left side of my face teeth hurt hoarse at times been on 1 antibotic for 20 days now going on another round for 30 days along with using nasonex what else can i do to prevent surgery,stay on those antibiotics and keep using the nasonex hot or warm facial compresses 20 minutes at a time can help as well as staying very well hydrated no one really wants sinus surgery but sometimes that is the only or last resort hang in there your doctor is doing the best that he can to avoid the operating room by keeping on you an extended course of antibiotics your situation has probably cleared up by now but i still had to respond because i had the exact same problem a few years ago i was in the exact same situation i was taking antibiotics nose spray oral steroids and everything else the doctor could prescribe one day i read about something called a nedi pot and decided to try it nothing else worked so i figured why not there are a few different types and i used the type designed where you put the solution in the container put the tip of the container in one side of your nose lean over a sink and squeeze until the solution comes out the other nostril then you repeat switching sides it is a little different design than the traditional nedi pot but i thought it might work better unfortunately nothing much more than the solution came out but then about 10 minutes later my left nostril started dripping out a little of the solution which is not uncommon according to the directions in the kit so i leaned over the sink held closed my right nostril and blew out threw my left nostril expecting just some remaining solution to come out a few drops of solution did come out but then all of the sudden to my surprise a massive clump of very thick dark green mucus dropped out of my nostril i was shocked and amazed i had never seen anything like it before and the pain and pressure on the left side of my face was immediately gone the mucus that was stuck in my front sinus cavity was so thick that the only thing that could get down to it and jar it loose was the warm saline solution that i flushed through my nose and sinuses with the sinus flush kit and the solution that comes with the kit is a simple all natural saline solution which is safe enough for even a child to use so for anyone who has ever had sinus facial pain and pressure you must try this sinus flush and i know this might sound completely disgusting but i wish i had recorded myself doing this flush so i could see it again or even just show people what happened because even to this day i am still amazed at what came out of my nose that day and all from a kit that cost approx 10 i bought the generic store brand and took about 10 minutes to cure what weeks of taking multiple prescription medications and numerous doctor visits

why i am craving only for sweet food  since i stopped contraception pills i could not stop eating sweet food i gained 6kg within 2 weeks and then i decided to stop so for 2months now i have not touched any sweet chocolate fizzy drink or bakery instead i eat dried fruits peanuts yogurts fruits porridge i cant eat salty even though i eat only healthy im always eating i feel this constant sweet food craving i have not lost weight even though im doing sports everyday not eating in the evenings i have been taking chromme for 1month,there may be a few reasons why you are cravings sweet foods one thought is that your blood sugar may be low and your body is trying to tell you that you need to eat something in order to bring your blood sugar levels back to normal low blood sugar could come about by not eating enough food throughout the day or by not making appropriate food choices it could also be from a lack of energy or exhaustion especially from lack of sleep where your body will begin to look for other sources of energy sugar can be metabolized and converted to energy very quickly so it is an obvious choice the cravings may come as a response from being very restrictive with your diet it can be hard to sustain an eating plan where you are constantly depriving yourself of things that you want to indulge in instead consider moderation and portion control as healthy alternatives lastly there are also psychological reasons for craving sweets as well for example when you are stressed you may sometimes seek comfort in food wanting something that tastes really good eating sweets can trigger a reward mechanism in your brain by releasing serotonin which helps to boost your mood and help you to feel better there are a variety of reasons for sweet cravings both physical and psychological it could be that now that you are off the pill your cycles are back to normal and you are experiencing more cravings related to fluctuations in hormones it also could be your restriction of sweet items is causing you to be even more drawn to them you first want to look at your diet is it balanced with all the food groups are you getting enough dietary fat for satisfaction what are your absolute favorite sweets have you tried incorporating items like dark chocolate or smaller portions of other sweet foods you like there is emerging research that mindful eating can decrease food cravings in people with eating problems that means eating meals at the table eating slowly enjoying food and leaving judgment out of your thoughts about food that means no more i was bad so i might as well throw caution to the wind or i should not eat that because it is bad for me  it is all about listening to your body and trusting yourself around food a registered dietitian can help you find out why you are craving sweets go to eatright org to find one in your area for more on mindful eating see this post on webmd is real life nutrition <link> good luck hi and thanks so much for your question there is a good chance that you have an issue with being hooked on or addicted to sugar take a moment and complete this easy 2 min quiz devised by experts from yale university <link> in your situation what you are doing is actually something we call eating around the addiction you did
can you re catch chlamydia from unwashed clothing  specifically i am at university and before summer term ended i caught chlamydia i only found this out mid summer and i left some clothing behind such as unwashed pyjama bottoms i have returned after having been treated and testing clean and without thinking i wore the bottoms i feel like i have had persistent symptoms which i can not seem to shake and do not seem to be thrush could i have caught chlamydia back from the clothingtowels even if it is been over 3 months since they were worn,hi this is from the uk is nhs you can catch chlamydia through unprotected vaginal anal or oral sex it can also be passed on if you share sex toys and do not wash them or cover them with a condom each time they are used it is unclear whether chlamydia can be spread if infected semen or vaginal fluid on your fingers is transferred to another person is genitals or by rubbing female genitals together you can not catch chlamydia from kissing or sharing facilities such as toilets or towels with someone who has the infection so as for 3 month old very dry clothing if there was some on them they would not be alive now but if you do have a re occurrence then that is all part of the chlamydia game it just loves to come back again and again sometimes the length could be up to 15 years or longer hope this helps you good luck

orbital fracture & numbness on left of face on 1028 i fainted i got a ct scan went to an ent dr he told me i have a displaced fracture and it would heal itself but my face still hurts sometimes the left side of my face feels like it is burning the left side of my face esp near the left templeeye area is still numb and my upper lipnose area is still numb also help any suggestions for next course of action and what type of doctor should i see thank you,i am sorry to hear about your accident a facial fracture is always scary the lingering numbness does not sound unusual to me it has not been even a month since your accident and it can take quite some time for nerves to heal the burning pain sounds like nerve injury to me and the numbness clearly is nerve related if you want a second opinion you might consider seeing a plastic and reconstructive surgeon these physicians usually have considerable experience dealing with facial fractures a plastic and reconstructive surgeon can give you an opinion as to whether you received appropriate treatment and whether your ongoing symptoms are normal or not i wish you all the best

if a mom says to her 12 year old girl i love u more if u were skinny will it mentally damage her  will the child also develop abnormal behavior and think abnormally i have a friend who is always depressed and she asked me why i would hang out with her i said becuz u are nice and clean and a good person and u love god she did not believe me saying that she was too fat for that and explained to me that her mom did not love her becuz she said i love u more if u were skinny she said she thinks her mom does not care if she was rude or disrespectful as long as she is skinny,we can not pick out our biological mothers any more than mothers can pick out their biological kids many statements that insensitive people make can hurt but whether this emotional trauma will cause lasting or permanent damage is unpredictable love is really unconditional and to say those hurtful words to a daughter is really bad she could really say and i would love you more mom if you loved me unconditionally 
right side of tummy hurts <negative_smiley> i am 16 the right side of my tummy not the right side of my stomach but like under my right boob  at first it hurt a little to the left of my right hip bone then it moved up to the right side of my belly button it hurts on the inside not the skin feels like sharp pain but not too sharp it started around saturday morning   i have been hitting in and rubbing it deeply a lot do you think that made it worse what is this pain i am feeling,i would say if this has been going on for several days that you should seek medical attention you may not necessarily need to rush to the emergency room but you should at least call your primary care provider several conditions can cause the symptoms you are describing including appendicitis an ovarian cyst which is not cancer so do not get alarmed or gallstones it is impossible to say what is going on without getting a physical exam if you begin to exhibit any of the following symptoms then you should go to the emergency room fever over 101f vomiting yellowing of eyes or skin pain getting much worse instead of better difficulty breathingshortness of breath i hope you feel better soon

are pimple like bumps around an area of eczema common in a bad flare up  my daughter developed a rash around an area she has eczema located in the bend of her arm inner elbow its reddened with pimple like bumps it seems to have spread a little bit up and down her arm from the bend she has no rash on the rest of her body at all or any other areas of eczema is this a common issue with a bad flare up it is very itchy for her,i would suggest setting up an appointment with a dermatologist when i was diagnosed with eczema by my general physician i was prescribed triamcinolone acetonide which did not do much it was later found out that i had psoriasis your description sounds similar to my symptoms and i was prescribed clobetasol propionate for two weeks followed by triamcinolone acetonide for 6 weeks or until the symptoms disappeared i am no doctor but i have a lot of experience with rashes as i have suffered from psoriasis for many years i would also suggest visiting an allergist as they would find out what is causing the flare ups eczema is typically allergy related if i am not mistaken lastly i would suggest cleaning all her laundry and bedsheets with sensitive skin detergent arm & hammer is great is she allergic to any foods maybe you could keep track of what she eats and see if you can pinpoint the flare ups to any particular food like i said do not take my advise to heart only my suggestions as i am not a physician hope i helped and good luck
is it possible to get pregnant with the possibility of pre ejaculation dripping in and then oral sex on her right after  we are not too sure if pre ejaculation dripped on her vagina but even if it did i performed oral sex on her i also urinated prior to the pre ejaculation along with all this she starts ovulating is a few days is it likely that she will get pregnant,hi so you urinated before sexual contact then that was good as this will flush any sperm from your urethra which was good i think your chances of her being pregnant could if there was any sperm be very very slight but please remember our male sperm is a dangerous stuff anywhere near a vagina if you and your gf want to play games suggest she gets on the bc pill this would make sure you both have no problems do hope this helps you both good luck

i want to know what i can eat while i have a stomach ulcer my doctor has me taking prevacid for a 10 day trial to see if it will go away she told me to change my diet but did not give me the specifics all the sites i have looked at have all been contradicting of each other so i just want to know what i can eat so im not starving all day,it used to be recommended that people with ulcers consume a bland diet but there is no evidence to show this is effective the key is to adopt a balanced nutrient rich diet to help the ulcer heal and keep your body healthy small frequent meals 4 6 times tend to be better tolerated than fewer 2 3 times big meals avoid or limit alcohol as it can make symptoms worse and delay healing of the ulcer avoid caffeine containing food and beverages coffee tea and chocolate as they can increased stomach acid making symptoms worse watch for foods that may cause discomfort such as spicy or greasy foods while your ulcer is healing see this article for more on diet and ulcers

why is it important to drink plenty of fluids during a cold,that is a great question bravo to you for taking a moment to question the conventional wisdom there are actually a few reasons why we exhort people to drink plenty of fluids when they come down with a cold let is take a look at these first drinking plenty of fluids literally can increase your blood volume and thereby scatter the virus molecules in your system so your own immune system can fight it better think of it this way which is the easier enemy to attack the one with 500 soldiers concentrated together or the one with bands of 10 soldiers dispersed here and there drinking fluid can spread out the virus in your bloodstream so it is easier to attack honestly though drinking fluids by mouth can only do so much in this regard intravenous fluids iv work much better for this purpose second drinking plenty of fluids tends to thin secretions    i e  that nasty gunk that pours from your nose and gets coughed up out of your lungs thinner secretions are easier for the body to move than thick sticky ones thick sticky fluids can get stuck in the lower portions of the lungs and lead to pneumonia if your body can not cough them up in this respect drinking fluids by mouth truly can make a difference in helping your body clear out mucus finally good hydration helps medication work better if you take any sort of over the counter cough and cold product or if you are taking a prescription such as antibiotics it requires liquid water is best to dissolve well in your stomach and get absorbed in the intestines drinking plenty of water also helps your body circulate the active ingredients in those medications more easily so they work better frankly drinking plenty of water and being well hydrated when you have a cold simply can make you feel better water should always be your first choice but chicken soup can not hurt either wishing you well

how many sperm do you need to achieve a pregnancy,technically it takes just one sperm to fertilize an egg and achieve a pregnancy but for each sperm that reaches and fertilizes an egg there are many millions that do not the average ejaculation contains close to 100 million sperm and according to the world health organization men who have fewer than 20 million sperm per milliliter of semen may have difficulty conceiving why do you need so many sperm if it takes just one to make a baby because the journey from the vagina to the fallopian tubes through which the eggs travel from the ovaries to the uterus is an arduous one that few sperm survive for those that complete the trip penetration of the egg is far from a sure thing the egg is covered by a thick layer that makes fertilization more difficult experts believe this process may be nature is way of allowing only the healthiest sperm to fertilize the egg thereby providing the greatest chances for a healthy baby

how do you care for an open wound after basal cell cancer surgery on your scalp  the dr was not able to completely stitch together the opening left and decided to leave it heal on its own they stitched together what they could and there is an opening about an inch by 13 of an inch big still being a working woman i need to wash my hair to go to work how is this cared for a cleaned also how long does it typically take to heal to the point it does not need a dressing or bandage ,for the most accurate information you should call your surgeon is office and ask to speak to the nurse he or she can advise you as to what post op care your surgeon prefers generally speaking it should be ok to shampoo normally be careful not to catch a suture with your comb or brush ouch  assuming you are not allergic to any medications you are probably safe to apply an antibiotic ointment to the wound such as a generic triple antibiotic ointment for a few days after that you are probably safe to use a+d ointment which does not contain antibiotics to promote healing this ointment is usually found on the diaper rash aisle of any grocery store or drug store you should not apply any hair product to the area like mousse or hairspray and you should not blow dry the area right around the wound it is very hard to keep a bandage on a wound that is surrounded by hair and you may not need to keep this covered if you work with the public especially with children such as in daycare or school setting or if you work in retail or handle money then i would suggest you try to keep the wound covered to avoid allowing germs in however if you work in an office environment for example you are probably ok to leave the wound uncovered this should not affect its healing as long as you keep it moist with either the antibiotic ointment or a+d until it scabs over no matter what wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water before you touch or bandage your wound the wound should scab over within a week or so and it will continue healing for up to a few weeks once a scab is in place you no longer need to apply any ointment or a bandage as i said these are general guidelines only your surgeon may have different preferences and you should consult him or her for instructions i wish you all the best

how is a sinus infection treated,for sinusitis caused by virus infection no antibiotic treatment is required frequently recommended treatments include pain and fever medications such as acetaminophen [tylenol] decongestants and mucolytics bacterial infection of the sinuses is suspected when facial pain nasal discharge resembling pus and symptoms persist for longer than a week and are not responding to otc nasal medications acute sinus infection from bacteria is usually treated with antibiotic therapy aimed at treating the most common bacteria known to cause sinus infection since it is unusual to be able to get a reliable culture without aspirating the sinuses the five most common bacteria causing sinus infections are streptococcus pneumoniae haemophilus influenzae moraxella catarrhalis staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes the antibiotics that are effective treatment for sinus infection must be able to kill these bacterial types although amoxicillin amoxil is an acceptable first antibiotic for an uncomplicated acute sinus infection many physicians choose amoxicillin clavulanate augmentin as the first line drug for treatment of a suspected bacterial sinus infection because it is usually effective against most of the species and strains of bacteria that cause the disease in the penicillin allergic individual cefaclor ceclor loracarbef lorabid clarithromycin biaxin azithromycin zithromax sulfamethoxazole gantanol trimethoprim bactrim septra and other antibiotics may be used as first choices if a patient is not improving after five days of treatment with amoxicillin the patient may be switched to one of the above drugs or amoxicillin clavulanate augmentin generally an effective antibiotic needs to be continued for a minimum of 10 14 days it is however not unusual to need to treat sinus infection for 14 21 days taking decongestants pseudoephedrine and mucolytics guaifenesin orally may be helpful in assisting drainage of sinus infection the treatment of chronic forms of sinus infection requires longer courses of medications such as augmentin and may require a sinus drainage procedure this drainage typically requires a surgical operation to open the blocked sinus under general anesthesia in general antihistamines should be avoided unless it is felt that the sinusitis sinus infection is due to allergy such as from pollens dander or other environmental causes it is likely that the use of a topical nasal steroid spray will help reduce swelling in the allergic individual without the drying that is caused by using antihistamines although both are occasionally used in many people allergic sinusitis develops first and later bacterial infection occurs for these individuals early treatment of allergic sinusitis may prevent development of secondary bacterial sinusitis

can diabetes make my hands itchy and numb,i am sorry to know that despite the best efforts you are not responding with current antidepressants and there are active symptoms i suggest the following treatment given a diagnosis of diabetes with depression tablet duloxetine duzela m 30 mg in the morning and 30 mg in the evening the reason for recommending this medicine is because it is quite effective for pain symptoms associated with diabetic neuropathy along with depression tablet aripiprazole arpizol 5 mg in the morning although it comes from an antipsychotic group of medicines my purpose here is to augment the action of antidepressants while addressing anger associated with depression tablet lonazep clonazepam can be continued as per the current level if there is adequate sleep in case sleep has been an issue despite the medicines i will recommend upping the dose of lonazep to 0 5 mg at bedtime regarding vilazodone i think it should be removed as it is causing intolerable side effects also this particular antidepressant has little role in pain associated with neuropathy and i think duloxetine will be a better option there is need to stop tobacco this is because many of the medicines mentioned above have poor efficacy when tobacco is consumed you need to consult your diabetes doctor as poor control of diabetes could be a significant reason for the poor response consult your specialist doctor discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent in case you have more questions feel free to write back to me for further queries consult an andrologist online   > <link>

is it possible to get constipated because your body produces too much feces is there is a disease that causes this  i have been dealing with ongoing constipation for over a year which has been worsening it caused me to eat less overtime recently i have been averaging 800 calories after exercise yet if i am not careful it feels like my digestive tract is completely cloggedfull within a span of 24 hours for the amount i eat this can not be normal  i drink senna tea every night to keep it at bay if i do not i end up with harsh laxatives  and fear for impaction i have tried anything from fiberwaterprunes etc,well i would say try to est soft foods my dad who eats like a pig i might add <positive_smiley> began having the same problem didnt lasts as long it began and before he knew it he was unble to go at all he waited 8 days before going to the hospital which i dont advise to find he had a tumor blocking his intestines from letting the stool pass they did a very minor surgery and gave him a better diet and hes been fine my guess is its possible you could have something like this but its not blocking completely only partly which could be the reason you cant go all the time a stool softener is a good idea rather than a laxative because it this is the problem you could stress the tumor and cause it to swell which would make the problem worse and its only an idea many people will disagree with this but sometimes a cigarette can help as they make people poop but thats a once in a blue kinda thing and only if you have no other choice at that moment either way this is something you should go to the doctor for they may want to go in with a camera i myself had tumers as a child which cause pain blood and blockage they were removed 3 times with lasers do you have blood when you go and not to be gross but is your stool normal of more watery when it does happen bacause it you do for sure have a blockage it more likely you will have more watery stool i hope you feel better and hope this helped you to some level <positive_smiley>
my period stopped two weeks ago and i now have a light brown discharge it is 24 days between periods what is happening,i am assuming that you are not using a hormonal form of birth control e g pillpatchringshot if this is correct then my best guess is as follows your normal cycle is usually 24 days from the start of one flow to the start of another this month it sounds like you started the light brown discharge on cycle day19 or so this might represent premenstrual spotting this type of spotting can begin as much as a week before flow some women will get it every month a few days before flow the usual cause is a missed ovulation or a decline in progesterone level that month this is not an uncommon or worrisome thing unless it happens every month of course if you have any risks for pregnancy that should be ruled out a reliable pregnancy test done on cycle day 28 30 should be done if you are sexually active if the test is negative and you have no risks for a new chlamydia infection you could choose to self monitor through the next cycle hopefully your normal for you pattern will reset it self naturally if erratic bleeding persists see your gyn or local family planning clinic lastly if you are using hormonal birth control then this would likely represent breakthrough bleeding from the hormones in your birth control method

does oat bran contains gluten is it ok to eat it if i have celiac sprue,gluten is the protein fraction of wheat rye and barley gluten contains several different types of protein each with a different arrangement of amino acids proteins are chains of amino acids hooked together  it is believed that several of these proteins are responsible for the inflammation that causes celiac disease also known as sprue or gluten sensitive enteropathy the proteins of rice and corn are different from the proteins in gluten and are made up of differently arranged amino acids they do not cause inflammation in patients with celiac disease the arrangement of the amino acids in the proteins from oats is intermediate between those of gluten and the proteins of rice and corn the most recent studies suggest that oats do not promote inflammation in patients with celiac disease or that only large quantities of oats can do so one concern with oat flour and possibly oat bran is that there may be contamination with wheat rye or barley during the process of milling

how do dandruff shampoos get rid of dandruff what is the difference between selenium sulphide and zinc pyrithione,there is two basic types of targeting dandruff with the dandruff shampoos one is to eliminate the scale and one is to affect the underlying cause somebody who has very thick scale and heavy dandruff you might need both products because until you get rid of some of the scale the active ingredient will not actually reach the skin to have the proper effect so the first products to get rid of some of this scale would be something like salicylic acid that helps loosen the scale and eliminate it from the skin the zinc pyrithione and the selenium sulphide target the underlying yeast or fungus that can cause the dandruff to begin with so you might need both products and you can either use them one after the other or alternate one shampoo one and the next shampoo the other afterwards you can still use your own shampoo if you prefer so it is a lot of shampooing but for some people who really prefer their own shampoo or do not like the way these products smell you can still use your own shampoo after and you can certainly condition afterwards as well

can perioral dermatitis spread on make up brushes,this is a good question and you are wise to think in terms of avoiding the spread of any contagious condition the good news is perioral dermatitis is not contagious dermatitis means skin derm inflammation itis because dermatitis is simply an inflammation of the skin though it is often accompanied by cracking and flaking it is not something you spread to someone else the perioral part of your diagnosis merely denotes the location of the dermatitis peri being around  and oral being the mouth  skin inflammation around the mouth that is all it is all that said you still may want to keep your makeup brushes to yourself cracked flaky inflamed skin creates a route for someone else is viruses like oral herpes or bacteria to enter your skin you can not spread your dermatitis to someone else but that does not mean someone else could not spread an infection to you wishing you well

my 18 month old screams when having a bowel movement she is not constipated and is quite regular daily she usually screams for about 5 minutes and then seems ok after she is done,i see your 18 mo old cries prior to a bowl movement and seems fine afterwards a most common cause for this behavior is 芒聙聵stool holding 芒聙聶 this usually occurs in older children during toilet training but i have seen it in children as young as yours if you or anyone has started toilet training i might advise you to stop the exact cause of this stool is not completely understood but it surely is associated with toilet training if your child does not perceive any pressure to be toilet trained either from you or any other caretaker and the behavior does not resolve itself with a laxative diet she should be evaluated by her pediatrician ljgmd
i am 26 years old i had met an motor bike accident 1 year ago where i fracture my right leg it was a kind of simple open compound fracture surgery was done & nail rod were placed there i have followed the doctor & do every things he said but bone healing does not occur instead the nail start breaking after i start walking without crutches the doctor added extra calcium supplements & waited further but no changes then i move to next hospital after 8 month a prp injection was given saying it was a non union & waited to see the reaction no good changes then after 11 month again surgery was done replacing the broken nail with another long & wider nailrod some changes were observed within 4 months then dynamization of nailing along with prp inject was made recently will it solve the problem what are the chances how long it will take to heal can i walk without support as it has been 4 month alreadyexcept recent dynamization,the healing of a fractured bone depends on many factors 1 type of fracture   compound fractures   take much longer to heal 2 displaced bone fragments   if the bone edges and parts have been displaced then the risk of delayed union and nonunion increase 3 infection   increases the healing time 4 disruption of the blood flow to the fracture site   also hampers healing 5 malnutrition bone disorders also prolong the healing time 6 early mobilization of the joint   before complete healing in your case you have 2 or more factors which have caused the delay in your recovery without first hand knowledge of your current condition examination of your xrays and a physical examination it would not be possible to give exact possibility of your prognosis i am sorry about that but platelet rich plasma prp does contain important cytokines and growth factors which when injected into a injured area helps to improve the rate of healing bone formation in your case and hence your recovery as mentioned in your history you may already might have had some progress hence if the fractured bone site heals completely which will eventually happen in due time   there is no doubt that you will be able to walk normally on the affected foot i hope this helps

how often do children get shingles  my 8 year old son has been diagnosed with shingles twice in the past year is this common can he be tested to find out what it is if he breaks out again   the first time he had it on one shoulder   the second time it was on one wrist the second time they said it could be shingles or a staph infection they gave him medication for shingles    thank you,first it needs to be conclusively proven that he actually has shingles the wrist is not a place one would usually see it since herpes zoster the medical name for shingles follows a nerve pathway there are lab tests that can be done ordered by his doctor including a direct herpes culture to any fresh sores that he may get i see shingles quite several times a year in my pediatric practice i can not say it is common but shingles does occur in children as this point i would question the diagnosis since shingles also tends to break out in the exact same area each time not on the shoulder once and then the wrist

i feel bone on the extraction site how to get it fixed,i have read through your complaint and the relevant details the bone exposure is a common thing after extraction of teeth but as far as there is no pain you need not worry about it may be the extraction was a bit difficult on the lower left wisdom tooth and the gums are healing slowly please do not disturb the healing process by touching the socket with the tongue often this might delay healing even further also do not aggressively brush or rub salt over that area sutures are not indicated during the healing process if at all it is considered it should have been put immediately after the extraction keep observing the region for another week and if not healed or becomes painful then you go to the dentist for application of a healing paste meanwhile maintain good oral hygiene and gargle lukewarm salt water twice daily this will flush out the debris locked in the socket and promote healing thank you for further information consult a dentist online   > <link>

how can i get my husband to quit smoking now that i am pregnant  we were both smokers before i got pregnant and when we found out i quit cold turkey but he has no desire to quit and it is very important to me because i do not want him to be smoking after the baby is born and i do not want to start smoking again either which i know will be much harder if he does not quit as well i have told him very many reasons to quit but he just says he is a man and can make his own decisions and he is a smoker he gives me many excuses i dont know what to do,i applaud your decision and fortitude in quitting smoking when you got pregnant it is not easy to quit and you should pat yourself on the back while i sympathize with and support your sentiments the truth is no one person can ethically coerce another person to do their bidding it probably will be harmful to the baby to be raised in an environment filled with cigarette smoke studies confirm a link between infant exposure to second hand smoke and asthma rates nonetheless you cannot force your husband to quit smoking each person has to come to that decision on his or her own can you compromise and convince your husband to smoke outdoors only this would benefit his child and at the same time allow him to live the lifestyle he chooses it also might make it easier for you to maintain your personal smoke free lifestyle i wish i had more to offer but your husband is going to do what he is going to do you have to do what you need to do and i am glad you chose to quit smoking i am a father of a recently born child i was told by the wife and quote if you want to smoke do it outside and so i took my 7 yr old smoking chair and headed for the door she has been a happy woman since and also i learned 1 thing from it it is so much more easier to change my bad habits when i know she carried my son for 9 months and still cooked and cleaned  and every bad habit i have could potentially put my son is health at risk p s tell him to stop being lazy and take his butt outside to smoke his baby cant defend itself

how effective is spinal decompression for low back pain,i am not sure if you are talking about surgery or some other type of treatment but since i know about surgery i will answer regarding that low back pain that is caused by compression on a nerve root by something like a herniated disc can be effectively treated with surgery in this type of surgery the doctor often removes the disc and replaces it with a spacer and a small piece of donated bone that will cause the vertebrae to fuse together after a period of time however there are several different types of lower back surgery that are used to treat low back pain you and your doctor will work together to determine what the best treatment plan is for your low back pain it is important to note you may still experience pain even after surgery to decompress the spinal column in the lower back i am not sure if that is the information you were after but i hope it helps

can i use vicks vaporub during my pregnancy i have a cough that will not go away i am 38 weeks pregnant,i would ask a few additional questions around the duration and type of the cough and if you have seen a health care provider previously for the cough in some cases it is not a good idea to suppress a cough as it can lead to infection etc we do not have well controlled studies regarding the use of vicks vaporub in pregnancy so i would recommend speaking to your health care provider before using the product
hit in an arm repaired with plates from fractures 10 years ago it does not hurt but aches with weight plate damaged  i had 7 fractures in my humerus and it was repaired with a stainless steel plate and 10 screws the collision was on the side opposite the plate i was in tremendous pain right after the collision but it mostly subsided within 30 minutes there is no bruising or swelling i have full range of motion and have no problem lifting things straight up however there is a somewhat constant ache and pain when i lift to the side also there is pain if i try to lift a lot ex 3 pushups,it is doubtful you could damage a stainless steel plate from a blow that did not even produce any bruising or swelling that does not mean you did not aggravate the surrounding tissue or injure a different structure such as a tendon or ligament the only way to really tell what is going on is to see a health care provider for a physical examination given your description however you might also choose to take a watch and wait attitude you can try resting the arm or avoiding those motions that cause pain to see if the pain clears up sometimes a little rest is all it takes if the symptoms do not clear up or if they get worse    or if by some chance you develop a fever    then i would suggest you definitely seek medical attention any time symptoms go from better to worse instead of vice versa it is worth a trip to the doctor hope this helps
i am thinking to have varicocele surgery would it help,in my opinion sperm count of less than about 5 million per cc or the motility below about 30 will most likely need ivf with icsi in order to conceive varicocele surgery is probably not a viable option for you with such low numbers an infertility doctor should be consulted for improving the quality of sperm when they are 15millions or more a varicocelectomy can be good option for you thanks

i was told to give my 15 year old daughter barley greens for low iron but can not find anything about iron in it  my chiropractor said barley green for her to bring up iron levels but i cant find anything that says barley greens is good for this,your medical provider should be addressing any low iron levels experienced by your teenage daughter the extent and type of treatment will depend on her hemoglobin levels type of anemia etc in my opinion managing low iron levels is not in the scope of chiropractic practice there are many many more iron rich foods other than barley greens if you can even find them so i think you need a medical perspective first how does the chiropractor even know she has low iron levels did she have an anemia blood work up the chiropractor knew she had low iron because our kaiser doctor had tested her in september and again in february we tried bringing the iron level up with certain foods but just could not do it so the chiropractor suggested that another client of his tried barley greens and it helped her so i am just trying to figure out the best way to get a 15 year old girl is up i hear there are iron tablets but they constipate you and there is different types just can not get a solid answer out of anyone
can estrogen pills cause hair loss on your head  i have been taking estradiol estrogen pills for two years my hair has been thinning badly so i got a prescription for transdermal estradiol patches one of the common side effects listed was hair loss but thats what i got the prescription to prevent please help i do not know whether to use the patch to stop my hair loss or stop using estradiol to stop my hair loss,hi found this for you excess estrogen estrogen the power player in women is bodies is your friend when it is appropriately balanced it makes you feel energized helps stabilize your moods and contributes to a healthy sex drive yet too much estrogen which can be caused by weight gain perimenopause or toxicity from exposure to endocrine disruptors which are rampant in our food water and plastic products can lead to thinning hair during and after pregnancy for example estrogen levels peak and then dip causing sudden hair loss for many women the best thing you can do is get a blood test done for a hormone check do hope this helps you good luck

can a panic attackhyperventialing cause blood sugar to rise  my son had his glucose test for cf yesterday and while he was waiting for the 2 hour results he had a panic attack and began sobbing uncontrollably and hyerventilating because he was hungry and realized he could not eat for 2 hours the clinic messed up and they had to put off his initial drinking of the glucose for 3 hours after he had already been there anyway his fasting glucose was 86 his a1c was 5 2 but when they did his post fasting it was 206,i cannot find anything linking panic attacks to high blood sugars it seems plausible that increases in stress hormones during a panic attack could temporarily increase blood sugars your son is a1c and fasting glucose are normal so the high blood sugars are not caused by diabetes

cascara is a night weight loss pill what is it and can it be dangerous,cascara is actually a laxative and it is found in a lot of over the counter weight loss medications which a lot of people are not aware of i would say if you are using this medication for weight loss use it for about two weeks and then discontinue it laxative can be dangerous you can actually develop a tolerance to them and actually the other thing is too you may become dependent on products like this to help you have a bowel movement so as a pharmacist i would not recommend using a product that contains cascara

is pregnancy considered a medical condition ,this is one question that will likely generate multiple answers with differing positions it is also likely that no one answer will satisfy all viewers as being totally accurate a medical condition is sometimes defined as an injury disease or disorder based upon that definition pregnancy does not appear to be a medical condition but others will argue that pregnancy can result in medical complications injury or other disorders and therefore may sometimes be a medical condition here is an interesting note in at least one state undocumented aliens had not been not been as a rule eligible for medicaid benefits but the delivery of the baby from a undocumented alien was considered a medical emergency and qualified for medicaid coverage it really comes down to our own feelings on the subject many would suggest that pregnancy is a natural act and not a medical condition others would steadfastly hold to the belief that all pregnant woman require medical monitoring and delivery treatment and therefore pregnancy is a medical condition
if you do not drink milk can that make you more likely to get scoliosis  my daughter who is 13 years old has just been diagnosed with possible scoliosis her spine is curved at 18 degrees she has to go for a mri is it possible she got this because she does not drink milk or did not take any vitamin supplements she is now on one a day as of march 2013,most helpful answer there is no correlation between milk intake and the formation of scoliosis in adolescence the nutrients in milk calcium phosphorus etc  are very important for bone health but not drinking milk would not cause scoliosis many people are lacose intolerant and do not ever drink milk and there rates of scoliosis are no higher scoliosis can just happen as a young woman she needs calcium for instance but there are other sources of this essential element in vegetables of course she may not eat those either give her that one a day vitamin but she may need an addional mineral supplement as well

i have a itchy rash that comes and goes what could be causing this  the rash appears in different areas of my body for an example a rash showed up on my wrist and stayed a while and went away later the same day it appeared on my stomach and then on my thighs etc its itchy while it is present at one point my hands first turned red and then start to itch really bad to the point i had to wash my hands repeatedly i work in the medical field so i wash my hands a million times a day what could be causing this reaction,this sounds just exactly like an issue that i dealt with for months in 2014 hubby and i went on vacation and on the last couple of days i was having an itch right at my waist line in the back it was not too bad and i did not think too much of it at the time it would come and go the day we got home it got worse i looked in the mirror and there was a couple of spots each about the size of a quarter that looked like hives i put an ice pack on it to relieve the itching and after half an hour or so it went away over the course of about 2 months my nutritionist and i tried and tried to figure it out but it would just come and go several times a day sometimes on my arms other times it was on my stomach or legs or back very random at times it would be circular in shape other times it would show up as long lines or irregular shapes definitely looked like hives though then suddenly it just stopped i realized one day that it had been a week and no new out breaks it started on our vacation in august 2014 and ended sometime around novemberdecember 2014 then just this past week it happened again i noticed my arm pits itching a little one evening but again did not think much of it was not too bad just a little annoyance a couple times the next morning i woke up to bright red pits and the same hive looking spots on my stomach i started thinking about what was different during the time that i did not have the hives the only thing i could come up with was the while on our vacation last year we had lots of specialty coffee drinks from a famous coffee shop that i will not name here i continued to have them several times a week until sometime in the fall do not remember when just last weekend we decided to have them again a couple times that weekend large ones two days later the hives were back that makes me sad but i guess maybe i need to lay off the expensive coffee drinks and just have my coffee here at home it can be different things for different people but thought i would mention this just in case it might help someone else i never thought at the time that my coffee drinks could be the problem and it may just be a coincidence but for now i think i will avoid them

how much fruit can you eat as a diabetic,in my view the role of fruit depends on the overall eating strategy if one is doing atkins or another very low carb approach then it can be problematic to eat more than a little fruit especially the higher glycemic ones like banana pineapple and grapes however for my patients who aim to follow my usual eating strategy focusing on vegetablesfruitslean proteins and lowfat dairy and minimizing all grains and fatty meats and dairy i have not been limiting their fruit intake with the exception of dried fruit limited to 14 cup daily at first i was a little hesitant to encourage fruit without limit but my experience with diabetes reversal has reinforced this strategy time and time again fruit has been crucially important for helping my patients stick to the plan most of these patients eat 3 pieces of fruit daily for example an apple an orange and a banana some patients eat even more i rarely have to intervene and ask a patient to reel it in on the fruit intake it helps so much with weight loss which offsets the rise in glucose levels that otherwise might occur another reason i can get away with prescribing unlimited fruit is because i am so strict about minimizing starch intake put it this way  every type 2 patient i have coached into remission eats at least 2 servings of fruit per day

could these bumps on my scrotum be cancer,some men have little bumps on their scrotum and they are concerned what is it could it be cancer first of all any time you want to know could something be cancer you need to see a doctor you can not guess you can not assume an online expert can not tell you what it is they can tell you in their experience what they think it might be but until a doctor looks at you and examines you and looks at that lump or bump there is no way to tell especially with testicular or scrotal irregularities if somebody says to me i have got a lump down there what is it i tell them you have have to see a doctor i can tell you what it probably is or what it is not but you have to see a doctor because sometimes testicular cancers can manifest exactly the way they should sometimes it is not that way it is a funny little ache or it is a little bit of fullness or it is a little bump so some men have scrotal bumps they are usually cysts what we tell men is if it is been there your whole life and it has not changed chances are it is not bad if it is changing like a cyst might where it fills up and then drains and empties those need to be seen because they can be removed testicular lumps are different they need to be examined often with a testicular ultrasound almost always by a urologist who is skilled and experienced in understanding the subtle little lumps and bumps within the scrotum of the testicles and surrounding organs i have recently learned through my own experience if you have bumpsflat raised clusters hard soft with fluid or not go to a doctor

i understand there are 4 options silver through platinum for health insurance along with the subsidies  so assuming that i make 46 000 do you know how much each plan would cost in this scenario,there are indeed four basic options in terms of health insurance coverage available through exchanges sometimes these are referred to as metal plans because they are bronze silver gold and platinum the bronze plans cover the lowest percentage of your costs all the way up to platinum plans which will cover the highest percentage of your health costs as a result bronze plans will generally be the least expensive available and platinum plans will be the most expensive unfortunately it is not possible now to tell exactly how much you will pay for each of those plans and the details of these plans will vary for example there will be different premium costs and somewhat different benefit structures for silver plans even within one state one insurer may offer a silver plan that costs more than another insurer we all wish health reform was a little less complicated and webmd is helping to make things as clear as possible but the good news is that you should have several options to consider and you should be able to compare actual premium costs and coverage details when the exchanges go live on october 1
i am post menopausal and sex has become painful and i have a blood tinged discharge afterward what could this be  the discharge was pinkish and mucus like i also have some pain under my fib cage in fromnt and back and have been experiencing some nausea and stomach pain do i have an infection ,i would guess that vaginal dryness is the cause of your primary complaint the lack of estrogen a chief post menopausal culprit if your vaginal walls are dry the motion of intercourse can make the penis like sandpaper to your delicate tissues after sex the pinkish discharge could be your body is attempt to recover from the chaffing  also your vagina is more susceptible to overgrowth infection of naturally occurring organisms yeast gardnerella etc when it is dry i would see a doctor before attempting self treatment for any sort of vaginosis and she could prescribe or suggest treatment for the dryness good luck

cannot deny me coverage for pre existing conditions but can they deny payment for kidney stone procedure lithotripsy,the answer is yes your insurer can deny you but there is a good chance it will not as long as you follow the rules of your plan it is likely with any fairly major procedure you will need to get pre authorization from your insurer in order to get approval it will also need to be deemed medically necessary however if you have kidney stones and they have been causing you significant trouble it is very likely the procedure will be covered in accordance with your plan is guidelines i suggest you call your insurance company to inquire about what steps you are required to take before going for this type of care and how it will be covered you may also need to include your doctor in the process to submit any necessary support for your need for this type of care

a friend contracted ringworm and i touched his skin but not the infected area what are the chances of contracting it  a friend of mine from a youth group i go to recently contracted ringworm on his arm he was with the group tonight and had the area covered with a huge bandage yet he would peel the bandage off just enough for people to see the ring and then immediately put it back on i never touched the infected area but i did come into skin to skin contact with him during a couple games and activities i washed my hands face and other possible areas of contact with soap but will i get ringworm,in case you did not know it ringworm is not caused by a worm at all ringworm is actually a skin fungus just like athlete is foot or jock itch you can get ringworm in a variety of ways from sharing a towel with someone who is infected to touching damp surfaces that carry the fungus the fungus that causes ringworm thrives in warm damp environments which is why it is frequently acquired in places like public pool common areas to your question you could catch ringworm from your friend even if you did not touch the lesion the reason is because the fungus could be infecting other areas of your friend is skin but not showing the characteristic ring mark yet if you have thoroughly washed and dried the skin areas that came in contact with your friend you are probably not going to get ringworm however be careful not to share any sports gear or towels with your friend and be sure to wear flip flops or other foot protection if you all are bathing in a common shower area or something like that by the way ringworm will not clear up on its own it needs to be treated with an anti fungal preparation your friend can try using an over the counter cream for athlete is foot the generic name is miconazole but if that does not help or if the ringworm starts spreading your friend should seek medical attention in rare instances ringworm is best treated with a prescription medication hope this helps my daughter caught it from her friend 5 yrs ago and it was from putting her slippers on i never caught it tho when i rubbed the ointment on her back where it was i immediately washed my hands tho too i guess different people affected differently by things

i have nose to mouth lines will dermal fillers fix these lines and how much does it cost,dermal fillers are generally used to fix those nose to mouth lines that would be from here to here and those are call nasolabial folds what i found though sometimes is that some people ask for fillers in this area but they have really lost volumes in the temples or in other areas in the face and putting too much filler in that area can create too much fullness without making them look younger and it does not always look natural so you need to have a conversation with your dermatologist about what your concerns are and they can point out to you ways in which you can soften your overall expression in a very natural way by volumizing the skin and the face in a way that has balance and harmony because we have so many new products to use between sculptra and hyaluronic acids and radiesse and evolence we have really great products to use and sometimes we use more than one product in the same person in order to achieve that overall natural result but this is a complete conversation that you need to have with your aesthetic physician which would be dermatologist or plastic surgeon to see what the right treatment is for you

is paleo diet recommended by doctors  i am very interested in this diet but i am not sure if its safe what is opinion of professionals,the paleo diet is not mainstream yet meaning most doctors probably would not recommend it this may change as the research grows the benefits of the diet include a focus on whole foods over those that are highly processed such as cookies it also focuses on vegetables and fruit along with lean meats fish and nuts the question part is that it excludes two food groups and one class of protein foods    dairy products grains and beans according to one assessment a carefully planned paleo diet can meet most needs except for calcium 671mg and vitamin d but provides 4 times the rda for protein and less than is recommended for total carbohydrates supplementation may be needed and we do not know the long term risk of a diet so high in animal protein as some research suggests it may have adverse health risks see latest study also there is the reality that while it may bring great results in terms of weight loss it may be challenging to adhere to long term especially if you like the foods that are not allowed view this <link>

how can i convince the medical insurer to pay for newly on the market drugs re cancer patient stage 4  my sister has metastasized breast cancer afinitor appears to be the drug treatment option with the most hope how can i convince the medical insurer to ok and pay for this drug treatment what are the most likely to succeed methods to put the pressure on them for the purpose of extending my sister is life with these new medical treatments,insurance companies pay for medications when a drug has received fda approval for treatment or there are advanced clinical trials phase iii and above which show that the treatment is effective what is hard for patients and families to sometimes understand is that insurance companies only pay for proven therapies not experimental therapies this is especially hard when the disease is cancer fortunately the national institute of health and drug manufacturers are very involved in clinical trials for new cancer drugs or new indications for cancer drugs clinical trials are very important because cancer drugs are generally very toxic and expensive and we need scientific evidence to decide on the best treatment options not anecdotal successes because each cancer patient is situation is different we want to make sure that a drug works for a particular patient not all breast cancer patients are the same some have limited disease some have advanced disease some breast cancers occur before menopause some after and hormonal and genetic characteristics can vary from patient to patient afinitor everolimus is fda approved for breast cancer in combination with aromasin exemestane for certain postmenopausal women the breast cancer must be advanced hormone receptor positive her2 negative and in patients who experienced a recurrence or progression of their cancer after treatment with hormone therapy using femara letrozole or arimidex anastrozole if your sister fits in this category then her cancer doctor can write a letter to the insurance company citing her qualifications another important avenue to pursue for cancer patients is clinical trials you can look up clinical trials on the web site <link> by cancer type and features in your zip code or state there are several ongoing breast cancer trials using everolimus afinitor that may be applicable to your sister talk with her cancer doctor about clinical trials and assistance in working with the insurance company to get the best treatment for your sister

is over the counter product dormin helpful as a sleep aid,i believe that that product actually contains an antihistamine what patients and consumers may not be aware is that many of the over the counter products contain antihistamines because they make you drowsy thus helping you fall asleep they are safe when used properly and follow the directions on the box but once again if you are taking benadryl or you are taking other antihistamines like zyrtec and things like that it has what we call an additive effect drowsy plus drowsy equals really drowsy so you want to exercise caution when using that a lot of people too may not realize this can cause things like dry mouth it could cause things like constipation when you have too much of these drugs together they are actually drying you up and therefore leading to these other problems we do not want to use these type of products in the elderly because of the fact that they can help them

how does fibromyalgia affect sex and intimacy and how can we address these problems,fibromyalgia and its chronic pain can affect sex and intimacy fm affects everything else so why should not it cause unique problems with sex and intimacy as well fm introduces new fears concerns and anxieties into a relationship and we must understand them and address them first understanding the unique problems fm causes with sex 1 pain the physiological equivalent of a cold shower we hurt all over and any pressure or weight or squeezing aggravates the pain sex is not supposed to hurt 2 fatigue no energy = less sexually active mental fatigue = decreased motivation = loss of libido = less sexually active the person with fm may go to bed several hours before the partner and be asleep by the time the partner gets into bed it is difficult to have successful sexual intimacy when one person is asleep since sleep is so valuable and so short lived for many with fibro any deep sleep will be more desired than sex esp[ecially] at 1130 pm 3 associated conditions ibs can cause nausea abdominal pains and more bowel alertness than sexual alertness depression can cause additional loss of libido interest and motivation anxiety can interfere with sexual responses poor self esteem can lead to lack of interest or embarrassment 4 medicine side effects ssris can decrease libido or cause sexual dysfunctions including ed [erectile dysfunction] in men muscle relaxers tricyclics and antiseizure meds can cause extreme sedation different meds can cause nausea or gi [gastrointestinal] symptoms and shift the focus from the bedroom to the bathroom so with so much negative stuff going on with fibro how do we possibly figure out a way to enjoy sex we focus on the positives of sex rather than the problems we reassure ourselves that intimacy is good for you your relationship and your fibro sex can be therapeutic let is count the ways 1 it is a physical activity is not physical activity good for fibro  2 it increases our body is endorphins 3 it improves blood flow removes toxins from cells and boosts our immune system 4 it results in stretching and then relaxation of our muscles 5 it reduces stress 6 it re connects us emotionally and intimately 7 usually we forget about pain during sexual intimacy we should reassure ourselves that we are not hurting ourselves by being intimate rather we are helping both the fibro and the relationship your partner is also dealing with fears and anxieties about hurting you so you both need to be reassured about the positive aspects of being intimate

i have severe trust issues with doctors how do i find a reputable doctor when i have not been to one in 8 years  when i was 16 i became ill and was misdiagnosed over 9 times from age 16 to 21 i continued having problems even having a colonoscopy and laparoscopy test after test answers were futile so i gave up i would go to a walk in clinic for basic ailments and physical exams i am now 29 and concerned about my health and i live in a new area i want to find a doctor but i do not want to be run around again is there guidelines that i can discuss when finding a new doctor,establishing a good relationship with your doctor is perhaps one of the best things you can do for your health it is important to routinely visit a doctor because some diseases and conditions will not present with outward warning signs or symptoms so the only way to know your risk is to get checked out or tested it is essential that you find a doctor that you can trust and who embodies a similar philosophy regarding health as you do proper research beforehand ask friends or coworkers who they would recommend call your insurance company for their guidance or visit the webmd physician finder found here <link>  that you can use to find doctors near you the webmd site allow you to pull up a profile of each doctor where it displays information like their education and training to help you make a more informed decision narrow your decision to a few potential candidates and then try doing internet searches for them to see if you can find reviews that people have written based on their experiences with that doctor make sure they are in your network if you have insurance as well perhaps a good way to get over your distrust of doctors is to play a more active role in your health ask questions so that you are well informed of what your doctor is doing or why your doctor recommends something remember it is your health and you always have the right to refuse anything if you do not feel comfortable or do not fully understand the reasoning behind it ask your doctor to allow you time to do more research before making any big decisions as well do not worry if you are still not happy after visiting your doctor or your experience did not go well you can always try to find another doctor that better meets your needs i share y our concern guidelines try to find someone who will recommend one older docs are best pick a female next doctors seem to be ignorant of the latest medical advances when asked about a certain procedure that is less invasive they immediately want you to agree have the outdated procedure that they are familiar they will not listen to your concerns no answers to your question about the latest in office procedures that are equivalent they have another patient waiting one p a twice suggested i medicate myself re   a sore that would not heal i used triple antibiotic with no results he suggested that i should go home and try use bacitracin  3 days no improvement finally i washed the area with dyna hex 4 sore healed and was gone in 2 days at the followup i told him what i did to heal myself his response was what ever works another specialist wanted to remove my friends gall bladder even tho there were no stones seen only some shadows gall bladder not needed operation refused do not expect

i have started jogging for exercise and the inside of my knees are sore what i can do beforeafter to help alleviate,the reason that you might be experiencing soreness in your knees could be due to a variety of different reasons i would first see how your body responds to doing other exercise that may be a little lower impact such as walking swimming kayaking water aerobics using the elliptical rowing stair climbing yoga or some strength training exercises you can determine if the problem is specific to the type of exercise that you are doing this way you might just be doing too much too soon with jogging try dialing back your current jogging routine by building in more days of rest in between exercise sessions spending less time per session or jogging at a slower pace you could also try experimenting by adding interval training into your routine where you incorporate intermittent bouts of jogging into your walking routine lastly try experimenting with different ground surfaces if you are jogging outside the grass or a dirt path might provide less impact than concrete also it might be worthwhile to invest in good pair of running shoes as well if your painsoreness persists in spite of making some of these changes then i would suggest meeting with a doctorspecialist and discontinuing jogging until you can find out what is causing this hi if you mean you knees and touching why you jog you need to change you jogging style but in the mean time get some baby oil or vaseline rubbed on them before you go out if that works you wont have to worry when you come home because there be alright stay fit stay healthy good luck

are vit d and vit b12 deficiency linked,vitamin d and b12 are not linked in the sense that one causes the other but is relatively common for someone to fall short on both of these vitamins for example people who do not eat any animal products vegans typically need supplemental vitamin d and b12 either from fortified foods or supplements both of these vitamins are found primarily found in animal foods although plant based products can be fortified with d such as soy milk sunlight is another source of vitamin d another example would be someone who had gastric bypass surgery    they are at higher risk for vitamin d and b12 deficiencies people with excess weight tend to have lower levels of vitamin d and additional b12 is needed after this type of surgery because absorption occurs in the stomach a third example is someone who is elderly they absorb less vitamin b12 from food and do not make as much vitamin d from the sun work with your healthcare provider or a registered dietitian to make sure you are getting enough of both of these vitamins there is not a direct link between a deficiency in these two vitamins but it likely represents a common denominator some vitamins require fat to be absorbed in the intestine these four vitamins a d e and k require fat and a very low intake can produce a deficiency in them damage to the pancreas or intestine can also interfere with the absorption of these vitamins vitamin b12 requires a few additional modifications in the body to be absorbed it does not require fat but a factor that is produced in the pancreas however its absorption also requires a healthy pancreas and intestinal lining

what are the chances of hepatitis b becoming a chronic disease,in the united states approximately 200 000 people contract hbv [hepatitis b virus] each year however only 10 000 to 15 000 of these people develop a chronic hepatitis b infection why do some people clear the virus from their bodies while others progress to chronic disease it appears that the immune system is the most important factor in determining whether a person can rid herself of this virus rather than develop a persistent infection the immune system is relatively immature early in life therefore the younger a person is when hbv is contracted the greater the likelihood that the infected person will become a chronic carrier of the disease if an adult is infected her probability of developing chronic disease is very low鈥攁pproximately 1 to 5 percent if a person contracts the infection in infancy there is as much as a 90  to 95 percent chance that her immune system will be unable to eliminate this virus from her body children fall somewhere in between having approximately a 25 to 35 percent chance of going on to chronic disease men are six times more likely than women to become chronic carriers of hbv the reason for this has not been determined also people with poor immune systems鈥攕uch as those infected with hiv organ recipients and those undergoing chemotherapy鈥攈ave a much lower success rate of eliminating the virus from their bodies patients who are the sickest during their acute illness especially those who develop jaundice or who survive fulminant hepatitis have the highest likelihood of totally recovering and thus not progressing to a chronic disease

i have a lump on my vagina that came back after it went away for a week it came back alot more painful and alot bigger,you will need to see your health care provider or gynecologist for a proper examination to determine the true nature of this lump your description is just too vague for me to be able to narrow down the several possibilities but one common lump could be a bartholin gland cyst you can do a little research to see if that fits the bill the fact that this lump is bigger and more painful emphasizes the importance of medical intervention
could i be pregnant without penetration   i was on day 9 of my cycle  my partner was wearing a condom  he was near the vaginal opening but did not penetrate  he was rubbing his penis on the clitoris  when he ejaculated he moved away from my genitals  i took a pregnancy test on day 27 of my cycle during the morning and it said negative  i am extremely stressed over this situation,from what you are describing it sounds highly unlikely you could be pregnant but i never say never when it comes to pregnancy if your partner wore a condom throughout this encounter did not penetrate you and ejaculated into the condom then i would say the odds of pregnancy are slim to none if your partner did penetrate you prior to pulling out and putting on a condom that is an entirely different story because any seminal fluid including pre cum can contain sperm which can in turn fertilize an egg if they find one there is no need to take a pregnancy test unless you have actually missed your period by which i mean it is at least a week late i realize some home pregnancy test kits say they work even before a missed period but those are not necessarily the most accurate tests to obtain an accurate result wait until you have missed the start of your period then take a home pregnancy test first thing in the morning when your urine is the most concentrated be very careful with the timing if you follow all the package instructions the results should be quite accurate wishing you all the best

can you drink alchol if you took two 800 ibuprofen  i took 2 800 ibeprofen pills because my back was hurting from a car accident that i got into a year ago but i took them probably an hour or so apart then forgot that i took them an an hr after that drank a small amount of alcohol,if this happened only once and you did not have any side effects then i would think its fine however if you do it on a daily basis or even more that twice a week you may experience some stomach bleeding or even ulcers ibuprofen is the active ingredient is motrin advil and others if you do make a habit of taking motrin or advil and then forget and start drinking alcohol you could end up in the hospital so be careful you do not need ulcers or have your stomach to bleed if you have other health problems ask you doctor about something safe to take and be sure that you do on occasion have a drink and want him to recommend something to take for pain that will not bother your stomach taking any pain medication with ibuprofen can lead to blood clots high blood pressure and stroke and you do not need that if you think that maybe you need to go to see your doctor then go i know that people can do pain medication and then forget i know i have but i learned my lesson so please when you want to take something ask your doctor or ask a pharmacist i do hope you are feeling better and please keep us informed and if you need any more help just let us know thank you

how do i keep track of how much medication is in my metered dose inhaler,check the side of the canister for the number of puffs it contains then keep track of how many times you use it each day this way you can estimate when your metered dose inhaler is likely to run out put that date right on the canister be sure to have your prescription refilled one to two days before this date some mdi is contain a color coded side window that indicates when the medication is running out it may be difficult for you to keep track of how much you use your inhaler    perhaps because you only use it every once in a while as a rescue medication if so ask your doctor about mdis that count the puffs each time you press the inhaler or ask about getting two inhalers at a time when one runs out get a refill so you always have an inhaler handy throw away the mdi when it is empty even if it continues to spray

what do i need to know about sunscreens and sun blocks,often i am posed with questions about the significance of the sun protection factor spf number there is an assumption that the higher the spf number the more protected you will be from the sun but you need not seek the highest spf available because beyond an spf of 30 you will be getting little additional protection the american academy of dermatology recommends using sunscreen that has an spf of 30 or greater that protects against uva and uvb rays and that is water resistant it is important to know that uvb rays are those that cause bad sunburns and are associated with skin cancer uva rays tend to be the culprit for skin aging but can also influence the development of skin cancer just not as ambitiously therefore i recommend using a product that protects against both uvb and uva rays it is important to know what happens to your sunscreen when you get in the water water will dilute sunscreen so you will need to reapply it reasonably often the recommendation is that a water resistant sunscreen be reapplied after 40 minutes spent in a swimming pool or the ocean sunscreens that claim to be waterproof tend to be a little heavier and more oily and should keep you protected for up to 80 minutes the difference between sunscreen and sun block is that sunscreen protects your skin by absorbing and reflecting uv rays sun block reflects and scatters uvb rays and creates a barrier between your skin and the sun remember that the sun allows the body to perform a self conversion for vitamin d which is essential for the calcium metabolism that impacts the strength of your bones vitamin d is very important and in fact may be critical in the prevention of certain cancers
what should i do for the pain and to cure my sinusitus  i have been having sinusitus the past year and a half and my head is really hurting i have had so many antibiotics and nasal sprays but none of them are working i am 14 years old i have asked my doctor if i can do surgery but he said no because it will come back because i am still growing i have also taked tylenol but it doesnt work,i am sorry to hear you are going through this sinus pain can feel so miserable sinusitis is an inflammation swelling of the tissue that lines the sinus cavities this swelling of the tissue can cause the cavities to fill with fluid which causes pressure and pain and sometimes an infection sinusitis can be caused by allergies nasal polyps a deviated septum or even smoke in the environment i hope your doctor has examined you to see if you have nasal polyps while polyps are not extremely common in 14 year olds they are not unheard of if you have not been examined for polyps you might ask your parents to get you an appointment with an ear nose throat doctor for an exam meanwhile there are some things you can try at home to relieve your symptoms including using a vaporizer warm mist in your bedroom be sure to clean it regularly because these devices can sometimes grow mold inhaling steam such as from a pan of hot not boiling water warm compresses wash rag soaked in very warm water laid across the eyesbridge of the nose saline nose drops available over the counter if there is a smoker in your household this could be a cause of your symptoms if possible spend as much time as you can in a smoke free environment because pets and other allergies can make sinusitis symptoms worse try to keep your bedroom pet free and make sure to vacuum or mop and dust regularly i hope one or more of these tips brings you some relief

a free blood screening = bun of 21 my creatinine serum was 0 93 and my buncreatinine ratio was 23 do i call dr,well let is start at the beginning i will include some links to more information the bun blood urea nitrogen test basically is used to give an idea of how well your kidneys are working a normal bun range for adults is around 6 20 mgdl the fact your bun is 21 is not necessarily reason for concern many factors including various medications can affect the bun result and 21 might even be normal for you it is hard to say without some past lab results to compare with serum creatinine ranges in adult men run from about 0 6 1 2 mgdl and for women the range is around 0 4 1 0 so it sounds like your creatinine level is within normal limits a normal buncreatinine ratio is considered to be 101 201 your buncreatinine ratio is slightly elevated but probably no cause for alarm however your best bet is always to consult a health care provider to discuss these results what is normal for one person may not be normal for another that is why we health professionals recommend you get blood work done every year by comparing past results with current ones we can get a better idea of whether you have a problem developing that needs treatment since i have no background information on you specifically it is impossible to say if these results deserve further investigation if you are at all concerned about them you should visit your primary care provider best wishes to you no

how rapidly should one is body fat composition change with diet and exercise,you can expect on average to lose 1 to 3 of your body fat per month but the range of loss varies widely between individuals because there are so many variables that affect body composition including age gender amount of body fat and muscle mass that you start with and a myriad of hormones that control how efficient your body is at storing fat and metabolizing it unlike body weight where no more than two pounds per week of loss is recommended there are no standards or guidelines for how quickly to lose body fat or gain muscle because there has not been enough research to determine a healthy body fat percentage you should also know that when you lose weight as much as 25 of the lost weight could be muscle that is you could lose 25 pounds of muscle if you lose 100 pounds the principle problem in terms of weight loss with losing so much muscle is that muscle is the metabolically active organ in your body that burns most of the calories and so losing it could slow down your weight  and fat loss efforts in fact losing muscle is one of the factors involved in weight loss plateaus the good news is that studies show that aerobic and resistance exercise can prevent muscle loss by as much as 8 and 20 respectively if you do it consistently three or more times per week measuring body composition during weight loss is objective data that could prove as important as measuring weight a bioelectric impedance bia scale can help you do that bia scales estimate body fat by sending a very weak and safe electrical signal through your body and then measuring the resistance to the signal created by your body fat fat is a poor conductor of electricity and so the more fat you have the more resistance there is there is a 3 to 5 error possible with bia that depends on your hydration status time of last meal last round of exercise amount of alcohol in your system and some medications for example diuretics the error can be even higher than 5 so be sure to follow the manufacturer is guidelines to obtain the most reliable estimate you can find bia scales online
i can not open my mouth verry wide without it poping and sometimes it get stuck open it all started after i went to the dentist when i was 16 after i was given a shot i felt her stick the needle farther then she was suppose to but after that is when it started is there anything wrong with me,have your dentist check for tmj this is where the upper jaw is popping and sounds like popcorn crunching temporomandibular disorders tmd occur as a result of problems with the jaw jaw joint and surrounding facial muscles that control chewing and moving the jaw these disorders are often incorrectly called tmj which stands for temporomandibular joint what is the temporomandibular joint tmj the temporomandibular joint tmj is the hinge joint that connects the lower jaw mandible to the temporal bone of the skull which is immediately in front of the ear on each side of your head the joints are flexible allowing the jaw to move smoothly up and down and side to side and enabling you to talk chew and yawn muscles attached to and surrounding the jaw joint control the position and movement of the jaw what causes tmd the cause of tmd is not clear but dentists believe that symptoms arise from problems with the muscles of the jaw or with the parts of the joint itself injury to the jaw temporomandibular joint or muscles of the head and neck 鈥 such as from a heavy blow or whiplash 鈥 can cause tmd other possible causes include grinding or clenching the teeth which puts a lot of pressure on the tmj dislocation of the soft cushion or disc between the ball and socket presence of osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis in the tmj stress which can cause a person to tighten facial and jaw muscles or clench the teeth

can i be pregnant after plan b i had unprotected sex in nov wasnt ovulating but of course took plan b the next day got my period a week later  it was earlier than expected a darker color than usual and lasted a little long i thought i was not pregnant but i have been having odd symptoms like bloating congestion frequent urination and hard stool i know these are not classic symptoms but i took a test the test said to get 5 seconds worth of urine and i did not have that much could it have been a false negative,hi plan b seems to be a very reliable form for an emergency like you described the likelihood of you becoming pregnant after taking this pill is very slim however i do know of one person that still got pregnant after using plan b it is said to work up to 72 hours after unprotected sex so i think you should be fine seeing as how you took it as soon as possible the symptoms you described might be some side effects of the pill it is a pretty harsh medication and does throw off your cycle

my mom is 87 her blood pressure is 120 over 65 i that ok,well without knowing any other information about your mother is overall health i can say that sounds like a wonderful blood pressure level for an 87 year old usually blood pressure increases as we age due to some natural stiffening of the arteries i am not sure if you are concerned this reading may be too high or too low a blood pressure reading of 12065 is pretty normal the second number 65 is a bit on the low side but that is not a number we are often concerned about the first number is the more significant one it should be below 140 and above about 90 if your mother is experiencing symptoms like dizziness feeling faint nausea or anything new and unexplained then you might want to seek medical attention but just based on the blood pressure numbers you gave and not knowing anything else about your mother is medical history i do not see anything worrisome wishing you well

my teen has anxiety which is controlled by medication but dr wants to take him off the medication why is this safe  my son was having hallucinations and was given antipsychotic meds 18 mos ago 8 mos ago he was dx with anxiety and rx anxiety meds he has not had hallucinations since 2 months ago dr stopped antipsych meds he is currently taking anxiety meds hes doing very well and still no hallucinations dr wants to lower dose of anxiety meds til he is no longer on med his anixety was so severe it caused hallucinations is it possible for a teen to outgrow anxiety to the point no med is necessary,i and my 9 year old son suffer from bipolar disorder which also can come with anxiety issues so i can understand your concern in all honesty i must give your doctor kudos for wanting to wean your teen off the medication many doctors who hand out meds for mental or mood disorders are like drug pushers the trouble with some of these drugs aside from the numerous and ill side effects in teens and young adults is that as your child grows and their chemistry changes these drugs are no longer effective then you have to try a different drug until you face the same issue it is a vicious cycle and the one suffering the most is the child who is beginning to feel much like a guinea pig by this point my advice is to give it a try to see how it works out if you have concerns about the anxiety returning perhaps the doctor would be willing to provide something to be taken in cases of extreme anxiety and if it turns out that this situation is not working out you can ask for your teen to be put back on meds please remember teen years are very anxious times for all children in teen years i experienced it myself and my own teen is currently having issues sometimes the best medicine is to assure them that they are normal and everything will work itself out anxiety attacks are scary and can escalate into all sorts of fears like those of being in the process of dying it helps to be reminded that it is only an anxiety attack not death and it will pass once they calm themselves i wish you all the luck <positive_smiley>

my 2 yo is anklefoot was crushed with heavy steel yesterday no fracture on xray is an aircast walker recommended  my son was playing at the base of our home treadmill while i had the unit raised to vacuum underneath it upon lowering the unit my son is foot was crushed in a 1 inch gap between two heavy steel surfaces x ray indicated no obvious bone fracture but immature non calcified bones may be damaged my son cannot weight bear the doctor recommends applying a plaster cast in 5 days if he is still not bearing weight would an aircast walker boot would be a helpful healing aid in the meantime,aw poor baby and poor mom having to go through this i would not recommend self treating this i would do as the doctor said and wait to see how your son is doing in 5 days your doctor has very good reasons for recommending your son is foot not be casted immobilized for a period of time it is possible that immobilizing the limb by using something like a walking boot could cause muscle atrophy shrinkage which would be damaging to your son if you have any questions about why your doctor recommended taking a wait and see approach then i would suggest you call and ask him in the moment of crisis when you are in the er and feeling anxious about your baby is health it is easy to forget to ask questions your doctor will not mind if you call and find out exactly why he is taking this approach with your son best wishes to you and the little one i have a aircast on right night what you might like about it is that it is designed to take away the moisture or air everytime he put is preasure on it also the hard plastic sides actually feels good around because of the air flow but yet secure that is hard to believe but it is true for me i am still not walking i probably tore something but regardless this aircast did protect me and with only 2 straps it is easier for you to remove and put back on also is designed to wear in a shoe i could not tackle that but as a mother of a young boy i believe this is the better choice that 5 day cast would make the transition harder for your child because it is so much heavier if your concerns is based on protection the aircast can do the job in my opinion

i have two pre existing conditions and i pay a lot every month in prescriptions would obamacare be better for me  or should i stick with my current plan,it is possible that someone now buying insurance coverage on their own will find the new health plans being sold on the marketplaces in some cases will have richer benefits but another huge potential benefit could be lower costs many people with pre existing conditions who buy their own insurance are being charged more because of their health that is another practice insurers will be prohibited from starting january 1 2014 you will be guaranteed a health plan and you can not be charged more for coverage also there are tax credits available to people making up to about 46 000 per year so that will lower costs for many people as well

easy home remedies for nasal dryness i have temporary nasal dryness from the santa ana conditions i do not want to go out and buy nasal saline spray for something that only lasts a day or two what else can i do at home for relief,a home remedy is perfectly appropriate for what you are describing a few suggestions humidify the air either with a commercial humidifier or by warming not boiling an open pan of water on the stove be sure to monitor the pan so it does not run dry and start a fire pour hot not boiling water in a pan then drape a towel over your head to create a tent and spend a few minutes breathing the humidified air you can safely use small amounts of water based lubricant like plain k y jelly in your nasal passages to keep them moist this is especially effective when done at bedtime simply place a small dab of the lubricant just inside each nostril you also can make your own saline nasal solution by combining 1 cup 8 ounces of distilled water with 12 teaspoon of salt heat and stir this mixture until well combined allow to cool use a dropper to instill one or two drops into each nostril keep this mixture refrigerated and discard after a week hope this helps
can a guys large penis make me bleed lightly after sex  until yesterday i have not had sex for over four months and the new guys penis is significantly larger than i have ever had  we used a condom and it only lasted a few minutes because we did some foreplay earlier and he came within a few minutes it hurt because it felt like my vagina was stretching obviously and when i got home i had to use the bathroom and when i wiped there was a little blood it is very light not even a flow just a few drops show up when i wipe,the vaginal area is very vascular and can bleed with minor trauma sexual intercourse can create just enough localized trauma to cause light bleeding this is no more concerning that a minor nose bleed when you have a cold but if the bleeding is severe or intercourse is unusually painful it would be best for you to be examined by your medical provider it is not unusual to find small tears fissures as a result of sexual activity

19 year old female synthroid 25 for approximately one year and my symptoms are still not alleviating why is this  i have been on synthroid 25mg for over a year now for diagnosed hypothryroidism i go for blood work every three months and it always comes back normal now that i am on medication on the other hand my symptoms still exist and affect my day to day life i am always exhausted and i can not seem to lose the weight that i put on when i was not diagnosed even though i work out and eat right i can not strengthen my medication why is this happening and how do i fix it,what is considered normal on lab tests may not necessarily be normal for you let me give you some background information the test they usually perform to initially diagnose hypothyroidism is tsh or thyroid stimulating hormone it has an inverse relationship with your actual thyroid hormone think of it as a bill collector if you do not respond when the bill collector knocks on your door they will start to knock on your door or call you with increasing frequency until you do respond the tsh is the bill collector and if your thyroid is not paying the bills aka is not producing enough thyroid hormone t4 tsh levels will continue to increase until the thyroid responds or your pituitary master gland decides its a hopeless cause and tsh production decreases or stops the reason for this diatribe is because people get confused when they are told they have hypothyroidism and their tsh is too high they do not realize the tsh is not actually the thyroid hormone which is the hormone that will be low in this case i just want to ensure there is no confusion when your provider gives you lab results some providers do not realize that if your tsh is in the upper range of normal people and especially women may still have symptoms thus you may want to work with your doctor on getting your tsh down to the lower ranges of normal 0 7  2 approximately  the range used to be 0 5 to 5 for tsh the national board of endocrinology now suggests the normal range be changed to 0 3 to 3 because people are still having symptoms despite being within normal range i prefer to keep my tsh around 1 because that is when i feel normal  everybody is different so that may not work for you what it boils down to is you are a person not a lab result if you have symptoms tell your primary care doctor do some research write down questionssymptoms when you think of them and talk to your pcp about it if you do not think he or she is taking you seriously get a second opinion

what are the signs or symptoms of sepsis blood poisoning,the patient should have a proven or suspected source of an infection usually bacterial and have at least two of the following problems an elevated heart rate tachycardia either a high fever or low temperature hypothermia rapid breathing 20 breaths per minute or a reduced paco2 level or a white blood cell count that is either high low or composed of 10 band cells in most cases it is fairly easy to ascertain heart rate count pulse per minute fever or hypothermia with a thermometer and to count breaths per minute even at home it may be more difficult to prove a source of infection but if the person has symptoms of infection such as a productive cough painful urination fever or a wound with pus it is fairly easy to suspect that a person with an infection may have sepsis however determination of the white blood cell count and paco2 is usually done by a lab in most cases the definitive diagnosis of sepsis is made by a physician in conjunction with laboratory tests some authors consider red lines or red streaks on the skin to be signs of sepsis however these streaks are due to local inflammatory changes in either local blood vessels or lymphatic vessels lymphangitis the red streaks or lines are worrisome as they usually indicate a spreading infection that can result in sepsis

why do i get attracted to both men and women,i have gone through your query and understood your concerns firstly if you feel attracted towards men and women both it is just your sexual orientation it is not a disorder the more you will try to get rid of these feelings the more they will disturb you secondly entering the vagina is a very different feeling as compared to just rubbing it over the clitoris your wife can best tell whether you penetrated her or not if you wife is very sensitive you can give sufficient time in foreplay rubbing followed by fingering and penetration should be the plan this will solve the problem of tight muscles also the head of the penis is always sensitive if your penile foreskin is tight your surgeon can help otherwise its normal to have a sensitive penile head 40 sperm motility is not too low in my opinion you do not need any medication for it slowly as you would be able to do intercourse properly your wife can conceive gradually she can guide your penis into her vagina hope this helps for more information consult a psychiatrist online   > <link>
any suggestions for healthy eating on nights when i am too tired to cook after work,you are definitely not alone however there are some of you out there that actually find relaxation and joy in the process of making dinner after a hectic day for those of you who fall into that camp consider yourselves part of the elite if you are already out and near the grocery store and are leaning toward getting prepared foods i would recommend picking simple things that you can quickly add flavor to and not calories like rotisserie chicken just squeeze a couple of fresh lemons on the chicken and top with chopped basil or use limes and top with cilantro pick out veggies at the salad bar 鈥 they are already washed chopped and prepped for you you can take them home and roast them in a 450 degree f oven for 5 7 minutes with just a bit of soy sauce and extra virgin olive oil this is a great and easy veggie side dish that would not take much longer than reheating something that would be prepared by the store and laden with butter or fattening oils sometimes we are too tired to go to the store and deal with anything that would take even just reheating for instance tonight i got home after 12 hours of traveling and i am battling over what i could make for dinner 鈥 or 鈥 to pick up thai food i think that thai is going to win tonight but i know that what is important if i make that choice is what to order i could dive into coconut milk soup deep fried spring rolls and curry laden with more coconut milk while this will be guaranteed to be delicious the extra 1000 calories that can come from some of the richer choices will not be worth it what will be a much better choice will still be delicious spring rolls that are fresh 鈥 not fried 鈥 and are filled with vegetables and fresh mint and cilantro are a delicious healthy choice another great dish is thai basil chicken and vegetables light oil ask for that when ordering at any asian restaurants also any soup without the coconut milk will be an excellent choice i am reminding myself of this as i am you when i am tired and hungry and have cooked for everyone else during the day the first thing i might go for is not always the best choice another small but important tip is to drink a big glass of water before you order out many times we are dehydrated as well as hungry so we are even more likely to make impulsive food choices

what is the best snack to eat before exercise and how long before my workout should i eat it,in general you do not need to eat before exercise unless you tend to run low on energy during your workouts or it is been more than a couple hours since your last full meal the best time to eat is about 30 minutes before you begin to exercise and the best snack is one that combines carbohydrates and protein with an emphasis on the carbs and you do not need a lot of food protein is not a fuel for exercise so you do not want to overdo it for carbs aim for the equivalent of a half bagel or a large banana for protein consider a couple tablespoons of peanut butter or a small cup of yogurt to get both if fresh food is not an option look for energy bars with 25 to 40 grams of carbohydrates and about 10 grams of protein steer clear of caffeine and warm fluids which tend to speed food through your intestine as well as dairy and high fat or high fiber foods all of which can upset your stomach slow down the absorption of carbs and leave you feeling sluggish you should also stay well hydrated and avoid super high calorie snacks because you might end up consuming more calories than you burn off

how will i know if my boss gets rid of company insurance because of the affordable care act,the only real way to know is to ask however if your employer tells you it is eliminating insurance because of the law i would be wary of the answer in fact the law requires all employers with 50 or more workers to either offer health insurance coverage or to pay a penalty for failing to do so they will also pay a penalty if at least one full time employee receives a subsidy to help buy insurance through one of the new marketplaces today 98 of employers with more than 200 workers already offer health insurance as do 94 of businesses with 50 to 199 employees and they have providing insurance long before the aca became law for a host of good reasons the law does not change for one providing insurance is a tax free form of compensation and a good benefits package helps employers compete for employees we have heard of some small employers holding off on hiring for fear of crossing the 50 employee threshold 鈥 it could certainly raise an employer is costs if they currently employ fewer than 50 workers and do not offer insurance and some industries with part time or contract workers are also reducing hours to avoid raising insurance costs because the law requires large employers to insure workers who put in on average 30 hours per week but for small companies the law in many cases increases health plan choices and for very small companies provides tax credits that can lower insurance costs i would need to know more about your particular employer is situation but on the face of it it does not seem eliminating insurance if it is already being offered makes sense because of the health reform law i have been in the health insurance business for 40 years the aca obamacare mandated a certain level of benefits that must be included in all health plans this is identical to the what every state legislature does when it mandates what is minimum coverage for auto insurance one wants to know that if someone crashes into you that they at least have enough insurance to fix your car if not their own the exchanges are simply private insurance companies competing for business in a marketplace they are all quoting the same benefit packages and are simply competing at price no one demanded or required them to compete for this business or offer insurance in the exchanges some exchanges have more companies offering insurance than others these private companies are doing so because they think they can make a few bucks it is not some government conspiracy to take over the insurance business that having been said one may notice that no other industrialized nation on earth has seen fit to copy our health care system it simply has not worked and i personally see very little on the horizon to make me believe it will work in the future in fact in response to the writer who suggested

could my girlfriend be pregnant  so last week my girlfriend and i laid naked in bed we did not have sex we did touch each other and i did not not ejaculate my gf told me that she has missed her period and she is worried that she may be pregnant i told here that there was no way sense i did not penetrate her and i did not ejaculate as a precaution i went to the drug store and bought her levonorgestrel a hormone that is used to prevent pregnancy is there anyway possible that she could have gotten pregnant,if the boy parts touch the girl parts whether you ejaculate or not there is always a small chance that pregnancy could occur sperm can be viable in the clear mucous that emits from your penis during sexual excitation the chance is very remote however so i think you are good this time if your girlfriend is also having sex with someone else that would be a different story having a little scare like this is good practice if you continue with your risky sex play you are eventually going to have sex why not try and prevent it your partner should be on an effective method of birth control and you should be wearing a condom an erect penis is a loaded weapon my worried friend yes absolutely if she is worried of possibly being pregnant then its always a possibility if she has been active in sex i would think the next best question to ask is could she be pregnant with my baby in which case i would highly doubt the possibility you must ejaculate she must be exposed to some way of having sperm get into her otherwise either she is really young and fear filled from ignorance and myths she is a manipulator trying to make you feel guilty or she thinks she really is and has had sex with someone else and is still a manipulator trying to make you think its yours you dont give her age or experiance or other times of sexual encounter # rod moser pa phd this is not an answer i could not find a reply button thank you very much for your quick reply it did give both of us a scare and we told each other that we would not be doing anything like that again do you think that the levonorgestrel will help should she take another to be sure i know you said that there was a very small chance but i just really want to make sure also is levonorgestrel the same as the morning after pill thanks luis garcia

my weight has hit a plateau what do i do,there are several reasons why your weight can hit a plateau including losing weight too quickly when this happens your metabolism the rate at which your body burns calories can slow down because your body senses it is starving rapid or large amounts of weight loss can slow your metabolism by as much as 40 in six months losing muscle when you lose weight up to 25 can come from muscle tissue and since muscle is the engine in your body that burns calories and helps maintain your metabolism losing it can hinder weight loss weightlifting can help preserve and build muscle reaching your body is particular set point    the weight and metabolic rate your body is genetically programmed to be once you reach that point it is much harder to lose weight and even if you do you are likely to regain it if you are at a weight at which you have hit a plateau in the past if your body generally seems to gravitate toward that weight and you are within a bmi body mass index range of 20 to 25 then you may be at your set point decreasing your physical activity andor increasing your caloric intake people lose weight all the time by reducing their caloric intake without doing any exercise but it is almost impossible to keep weight off without exercising many scientists agree that physical activity is the single best predictor of whether a person will maintain a weight loss other health factors including thyroid or adrenal gland problems medications like antidepressants quitting smoking menopause and pregnancy even with any of the above factors the bottom line to losing weight is eating fewer calories than you burn studies show that people almost always underestimate how many calories they are eating so if you are struggling with weight loss you are still exercising and you have ruled out any of the above reasons for weight plateaus look at your calorie intake as for exercise and weight plateaus sometimes a change in routine can help instead of the treadmill try the bike or the stepper instead of a dance class try a stretch and tone class if you are not weight lifting this would be a good time to start if you already do aerobic exercise try adding intervals short bursts of higher intensity exercise to your aerobic workouts and keep reminding yourself that if you maintain an active lifestyle and continue with healthy eating you will reach your goals it can be frustrating when you are putting so much hard work into losing weight only to hit a plateau do not be discouraged a few simple changes may be all that you need for exercise consider the f i t t principle f 鈥 frequency 鈥 how often or how many days you exercise i 鈥 intensity 鈥 how hard you work during your exercise t 鈥 time 鈥 how long or how many minutes you spend per session t 鈥

i live in georgia i am unemployed and am my 93 year old father is caregiver i do not file taxes will i qualify for 100 subsidized health insurance,unfortunately georgia is one of the states that did not expand their medicaid program as written the affordable care act required all states to expand their medicaid program for people up to 138 of the federal poverty level about 16 000 with the federal government paying the full share of the cost the supreme court struck down this requirement however and made it optional for states because your state did not expand its medicaid program you may not be eligible for medicaid you should still check with your marketplace however to confirm because your income is so low that you do not need to file taxes you will probably not qualify for a federal subsidy to pay for private insurance either because the law assumed states would expand their medicaid programs the federal subsidies were only made available for people between 100 and 400 of the poverty level because you do not file taxes however you will not be subject to any tax penalty for not having insurance a small consolation i know

how to get rid of the poison ivy rashes  although i thought i was being careful when cutting down some poison ivy in by backyard i now have it itching is under control but can anyone help on getting rid of the rashes or do i just wait it out got it 5 days ago it is also spreading to my surprise i read that it would only spread from the original toxic oils from the plant not after exposure i am not even very itchy but every day have a new patch of rashes,you are correct about it appearing to spread based on your original exposure you may have been exposed by the oils on your clothing or shoes that you touched later or by some of the tools you used to cut it down the oleoresin is so stable that it can last on objects for years so you better carefully wash any clothing or objects that may have become contaminated if you have a dog and dog came in contact with poison ivy the oil can be on the fur so wash the dog too in my opinion there is no such thing as a mild case of poison ivy so i tend to treat them more aggressively based on my own childhood experience of the misery it causes prescription prednisone topical steroids and oral antihistamines is the treatment of choice so it is time to consult a medical provider

i have pcos why do i gain weight if i am active and eat well can i get back to the way i was last year 100 lbs less  i used to be a model very healthly and very active i went on the birth control pill for a couple of weeks but they made me very sick so i went off of them that is when this all started i have always been very active and very healthy now i am losing all of my hair very seldom do i menstrate i have excessive body hair growth i gained about 100 pounds and i have many more symptoms i have been tossed back and fourth between doctors and noone helps me they just brush me off on to others,pcos is the most common hormonal problem in young women it can cause infertility diabetes and an increased risk of some cancers the signs of this condition often include irregular periods acne and increase or abnormal distribution of body hair most women with pcos have problems with weight management there are many treatments that target specific goals oral contraception normalizes periods improves acne and can help reduce facial hair diabetes medications help improve insulin sensitivity and reduces the risk of insulin resistant and type 2 diabetes ovulation induction can help women achieve pregnancy but dieting exercise and weight loss are the cornerstone of treatment and targets all of the above pcos cannot be cured but it can be treated so it is important to stick to your treatment even more critical is that you know what your treatments targets not all women with pcos have the same objectives when seeking medical care it appears that your goal is successful weight loss and weight management you need a health care team that knows how to handle weight issues more aggressively set realistic goals what are your pounds per week to loss what is a reasonable calorie restriction for you what is your exercise plan and how will you monitor these intervention and stick with your plan your plan will help you and your healthcare providers move you toward weight loss and better health one of many suggestions that i give patients are apps for smart phones and a buddy systems for exercise you will be more accountable and likely to follow through at the time of your follow up your doctor will then have information to push more aggressively through better nutritional consultation prescription medications or surgery do not take this lightly i went several years after being diagnosed with pcos and having mds tell me to exercise and diet even though i was they looked at me like i was crazy and just flat out lieing to them it took me many many years to find a doctor that actually did some tests which lead to a biopsy which was possitive for cancer everyone else said i was too young in my early 30 is to have any such problem the biopsy results came in on a friday morning and i had a full hysterectomy and oopherectomy the following monday after i healed from surgery i lost a 50 pounds without doing anything different at all i still continue to loose weight without doing anything extreme im about 35 pounds overweight my self 40 yr old male loved to eat and had a few problems with my health so i turned evil and went on a 10 day lemonwater cleansing lost 14 pounds and i feel better my outlook on everything has changed in 10 painful and long days so i say to you give it a try you dont have to go 10 days just start out for 3 days and see how you feel the more days you

can a broken bone or a muscle tear cause a fever  my father fell a month ago and has been experiencing pain in the arm he fell on he will not go to a doctor because he does not have insurance just this week he said he had a sweating spell and has been feeling under the weather for a few days no other symptoms then he thinks he had a fever and even muscles in chest ache so i am not sure if he just caught some virus or if maybe something from his fell is trying to tell his body,whenever you have significant physical trauma that results in an injury inflammation will occur on the site where the most impact occurred when inflammation happens some people will develop a low grade 99 9 oral temperature fever due to the body working hard to heal itself sweating could be contributed to such a fever as you are warmer than usual as for the chest pain it could be associated with his arm being hurt but it depends on how he fell how far he fell and exactly how he landed he could have injured more than originally thought for temporary relief he should try r i c e rest ice compression elevation and perhaps some ibuprofen motrin advil to reduce swellingpainfever acetaminophine tylenol should be fine as well if that works better for him but it does not have an anti inflammatory component like ibuprofen does ultimately the best thing to do is to see a physician just to be certain that everything is alright and there is not something more serious occurring most urgent care facilities will see you same day with or without insurance emergency departments will as well but they are usually more congested and expensive i hope this helps best of luck to you

how does bipolar disorder affect someone over time,i have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder i have struggled and struggled and even though i am on daily meds i still have trouble this answer is from my own experience and from my heart people are genetically predisposed to bpd that means we are born with it and will die with it there is no cure so the first way it affects us over time is that it is a constant cross to bear  for our entire lives and we either cope or literally die suicide risky behavior or pissing off the wrong person during an episode of rage are some threats to our existence i have been dangerously near suicide four times   i remember them especially because i was serious another way it affects us over time   it is like a failing marriage things are ok a lot of the time but the more and more you argue with the same person about the same thing the frustration compounds and you would do anything just to make this so and so go away well you can get out of a bad marriage i have been aware of my disorder for five years now and i am 35 so this is as far as my experience goes i do not know how i will be at 40 50 60 but from the way it looks now my strategies will have to change and become more potent if i am to survive it is literally a constant battle except that your sworn enemy and foe is inside your head and it is smart it is similar to our smartphones and apps now the ones that learn your search preferences and even your voice over time it finds a way to use your own thoughts against you for example if i am going through a mixed manic depressive episode i believe with all my heart  that no one loves me that i am a failure that i will never be ok and that i should just take myself out it is literally temporary insanity i am a healthy vibrant attractive career oriented single mother of a beautiful daughter with a fully loving and supportive family a therapist who loves me and stays on standby and i have goals i am a normal person but during those times i am absolutely certain that i am alone that i will fail at my goals like so many times before and that i have no reason to go on living its the disease it talks to me in my head and it is hard to differentiate between the sane voice and the insane one until the episode is over then i am perfectly ok just like that lastly things that are affected over time are relationships with friends family and romantic relationships and jobs we struggle with dealing with ourselves so of course others who have to deal with us struggle too i have had to re start

should patients with the flu like or mono like illness of primary hiv infection be treated,there are theoretical reasons why patients identified with hiv around the time they are first infected primary acute infection may benefit from the immediate initiation of potent antiviral therapy preliminary evidence suggests that unique aspects of the body is immune response to the virus may be preserved by this strategy it is thought that treatment during the primary infection may be an opportunity to help the body is natural defense system to work against hiv thus patients may gain improved control of their infection while on therapy and perhaps even after therapy is stopped at one time the hope was that if therapy was started very early in the course of the infection hiv could be eradicated most evidence today however suggests that this is not the case consequently early treatment is not likely to result in a cure although other benefits may still exist the current recommendation is that patients with primary infection should be referred to clinical studies where the potential role of therapy can be discussed and further explored if emotional or social situations make adherence to such treatment questionable however the patients are clearly better off delaying therapy

can taking omega 3 dea have the same results as taking plavis i was taking plavix for at least 11 years and have never felt good 3 months ago i stopped taking plavix and feel better my question is does taking omega3 fish oils have the same affect on the blood,i strongly urge you to contact your doctor as soon as possible by going off plavix you have put yourself at a much greater risk of experiencing a life threatening blood clot no one should discontinue a prescription blood thinner without consulting their doctor first you do not say why you were prescribed plavix clopidogrel but it is often given to people after they have had a heart attack recent stroke angioplasty procedure or if they have peripheral vascular disease these conditions put a person at an increased risk of developing a blood clot that travels to the lungs or possibly the brain causing problems breathing or a stroke to answer your question omega 3 oils are thought to have blood thinning properties but they are in no way a substitute for a prescription anticoagulant like clopidogrel in fact a 2002 study showed they had no effect on coagulation or platelet function after surgery clopidogrel works by making your platelets a type of red blood cell that enables blood to clot more slippery so they do not stick together easily this effect reduces the chances of blood clotting and traveling to the lungs or brain again i urge you to contact your doctor and discuss this issue with him or her at three months without plavix you could very well have a blood clot brewing your healthcare provider will want to examine you and perhaps run some tests to make sure you are safe there are many other types of anticoagulants available for your use besides clopidogrel if that product causes side effects wishing you well

are cosmetic surgeons board certified,there was an interesting article several months ago in health leaders the article pointed out that there is every good reason for patients to understand the nature of a doctor is training and by which board he is certified first let me explain that board certification implies that the doctor has 鈥減assed the tests 鈥 the tests are completion of an approved residency program and passing oral and written examinations at the conclusion of the residency these residency programs are monitored by the individual specialty as well as other credentialing organizations such as the american medical association the american college of surgeons the american hospital association the american residency system is the envy of the world board certification is an important qualification credential and emblem that one is considered in the eyes of his fellow doctors to be qualified to practice the specialty the confusion arises in areas where there is no specific board cosmetic surgery is one of those there is no american board of cosmetic surgery that is within the scope of the american board of medical specialties that organization regulates the 23 major specialties in most states any licensed physician is not restrained from any aspect of medical practice that may sound surprising but the reality is that states only license physicians as physicians and not by specialty it has been stated that 鈥渃osmetic surgery can be performed by any licensed physician from a plastic surgeon to a pediatrician 鈥 the reality is that you will not find any pediatricians or psychiatrists performing cosmetic surgery because they cannot get privileges to perform them in a properly credentialed hospital or outpatient surgery center the medical board of california which licenses and disciplines doctors does list each physician is board certification that information is given to the board by the physician himself every doctor should be proud of his background training and credentials it should not be hard for patients to glean whether or not the specialty in which a doctor is certified is appropriate for their particular needs

are yeast infections contagious,no yeast infections are not contagious in the way a cold or the flu is yeast infections are caused by a fungus more specifically a yeast called candida candida is a commensal organism meaning that under healthy conditions it lives harmlessly in our bodies we all have candida living on our skin and in our intestines and healthy women carry candida in their vaginas when the body is defenses are in balance candida is not noticeable or bothersome however certain conditions can give candida the opportunity to grow excessively a low functioning immune system use of topical or oral corticosteroids such as prednisone often for asthma or autoimmune conditions damage to the mucous membranes the skin lining the mouth vagina and gi tract antibiotic use in these situations candida can grow on the skin or in the lining of the mouth gi tract or vagina the fungus creates a white patch or plaque across the mucous membranes in the mouth visible candida infection is called thrush in the vagina it is a yeast infection in people with weakened immune systems candida can grow almost anywhere in the body because candida is normally present in all our bodies someone with thrush can not exactly pass it to someone else    that person already has candida to develop thrush a yeast infection or another candida infection that person may have one or more of the above risk factors or conditions
will a fluid diet of 1 2weeks help eczema  ive suffered all my life from eczema in my elbow creases but in the past year stress has caused it to spread all over my arms and onto my shoulders i was recomended to try a fluid diet and i was wondering if that would help to clear it enough to give the cream a chance to really help because im in a lot of pain and its really itchy thank you  hannah,a fluid diet for eczema never heard of it as part of any treatment eczema is genetically dry skin so if you are having an exacerbation or worsening of your symptoms you may need a change in treatment the mainstay of eczema management is moisturization so find a good moisturizing cream that is free of perfumes topical steroid creams are very helpful but the best ones require a prescription call your medical provider control itching with antihistamines assuming you can take this type of medication please avoid scratching and digging at these areas open eczematous skin can become secondarily infected so if you think your eczema is infected you will need to consult your medical provider for treatment usually antibiotics eczema is usually with you for life so finding the right combination of medications and supportive treatments is important i do not think a fluid diet for two weeks is going to help in any way

i have started jogging for exercise and the inside of my knees are sore what i can do beforeafter to help alleviate,the reason that you might be experiencing soreness in your knees could be due to a variety of different reasons i would first see how your body responds to doing other exercise that may be a little lower impact such as walking swimming kayaking water aerobics using the elliptical rowing stair climbing yoga or some strength training exercises you can determine if the problem is specific to the type of exercise that you are doing this way you might just be doing too much too soon with jogging try dialing back your current jogging routine by building in more days of rest in between exercise sessions spending less time per session or jogging at a slower pace you could also try experimenting by adding interval training into your routine where you incorporate intermittent bouts of jogging into your walking routine lastly try experimenting with different ground surfaces if you are jogging outside the grass or a dirt path might provide less impact than concrete also it might be worthwhile to invest in good pair of running shoes as well if your painsoreness persists in spite of making some of these changes then i would suggest meeting with a doctorspecialist and discontinuing jogging until you can find out what is causing this
i had a partical hysterectomy in my 30 is im 45 now could i be in perimenopause  i have noticed in the past few months i am finding it harder to concentrate i have not much desire to participate in anything i am so tired but not sleepy having some periods of crying for no reason i get frustrated easily and have less patience for silly things i get angry easily and hold on to it i do not like the way i feel which makes me even more upset omg what the heck,i am sorry to hear you are experiencing these distressing symptoms being a woman is rarely easy when you say you had a partial hysterectomy  i am not sure exactly how to interpret that the term hysterectomy refers to removal of the uterus only however many women use the term to mean they had their uterus and their ovaries removed are you saying you had your uterus removed but retained one or both ovaries i am going to go with that interpretation at age 45 you could indeed be entering menopause it is a little early but not unheard of having had your uterus removed should not really affect how well your ovaries function maybe they are just starting to wind down naturally your best bet is to see a gynecologist he or she can assess whether or not you are in perimenopause if you are there are certain things you will want to know such as how menopause affects vaginal tissue you may also want to decide whether or not to go on hormone replacement therapy of course there could be other causes for your symptoms a sluggish thyroid comes to mind we women tend to attribute all our mood changes to estrogen levels but that is not valid many other hormones can affect the way we feel physically and emotionally it would be good to get a workup from a medical professional to find out what is really going on wishing you well
why am i hearing double  i have noticed that i have been hearing double lately it just happened randomly a couple days ago after i woke up and it will not go away i hear everything normal but at the same time i am also hearing a muffled version i am really starting to get worried now since it is affecting me being able to listen to things properly my mother said it would go away but it still has not i would love any kind of answer to help me fix this so it does not go on much longer,in order to offer you a solution one must first determine a reason this will take a hands on examination not something that i can do over the internet if the symptoms persist you will need to see an ear nose and throat specialist sometimes an echo in your hearing is caused by your eustachian tubes not closing properly a variety of reasons for that hopefully you are not listening to loud music through ear buds because inner ear disorders can be caused by acoustic damage
what to take vomiting and achy feeling started with upset stomach,i am sorry to hear you are feeling poorly often the best initial treatment for vomiting is to avoid taking anything by mouth including water until the vomiting stops then start with small sips of water to make sure you are not going to start vomiting again work your way up to regular food slowly after the vomiting stops be sure to stay as well hydrated as you can without triggering more nausea if the vomiting is severe or does not clear up within a day you should seek medical attention also if your vomiting is accompanied by other symptoms such as severe abdominal pain or head injury you should seek immediate medical attention if you have no allergies to medication you can probably treat the vomiting and aches with over the counter medications ask a pharmacist what he or she recommends if you did not get a flu shot be aware the flu season is already underway wash your hands frequently to avoid spreading the flu if that is what you have or any potentially contagious illness hope you feel better soon

can you put regular vicks on an infant  im wanting to put vicks on my baby because she has a cold that comes with a cough so i was wondering does it have to be baby vicks or can you use the regular type adults use and if so what is the difference between the two i was planning to put it on her feet because she has a pretty bad cough and i heard that doing that can really help also she is a few days shy of turning 5 months if that changes anything thanks in advance,we do not recommend vicks for the babies in our clinic even though our parents used it on us and we survived the ingredients in vicks has the potential of making a cough worse due to an allergic or irritant response so we do not endorse it and i have to say that vicks on the feet will only make the feet a bit softer because of the petroleum jelly but it will not cure a cold or calm a cough please do not tell your mother or grandmother that i told you this a five month old is experiencing our germ filled world for the first time on her own    your maternal immunity will completely wear out by six months even if you are breast feeding because they are so darn cute at this age people pick them up touch them and expose them so their cuteness is their own fault she is also teething and drooling so this drainage is contributing to the cough when she is lying down coughing helps clear her airway and helps prevent the fluid from going in her lungs so it is really a good thing use a cool mist humidifier suck out the nose i know they hate it and just hang in there colds last a week or two but she will average 6 9 of these per year from now on until she is about six each cold makes her a bit stronger so think of these frequent viral episodes as free immunizations

what are gallstones,gallstones are stones that form in the gall bile bile is a watery liquid made by the cells of the liver that is important for digesting food in the intestine particularly fat liver cells secrete the bile they make into small canals within the liver the bile flows through the canals and into larger collecting ducts within the liver the intrahepatic bile ducts the bile then flows within the intrahepatic bile ducts out of the liver and into the extrahepatic bile ducts    first into the hepatic bile ducts then into the common hepatic duct and finally into the common bile duct from the common bile duct there are two different directions that bile can flow the first direction is on down the common bile duct and into the intestine where the bile mixes with food and promotes digestion of food the second direction is into the cystic duct and from there into the gallbladder often misspelled as gall bladder once in the gallbladder bile is concentrated by the removal absorption of water during a meal the muscle that makes up the wall of the gallbladder contracts and squeezes the concentrated bile in the gallbladder back through the cystic duct into the common duct and then into the intestine concentrated bile is much more effective for digestion than the un concentrated bile that goes from the liver straight into the intestine the timing of gallbladder contraction    during a meal    allows the concentrated bile from the gallbladder to mix with food gallstones usually form in the gallbladder however they also may form anywhere there is bile in the intrahepatic hepatic common bile and cystic ducts gallstones also may move about within bile for example from the gallbladder into the cystic or common duct

why do we need sleep,it is a simple question that you would think would have a simple answer we know that sleep has restorative effects on our bodies down to the cellular level but how it all works from a biological perspective has been somewhat of a mystery now we have got more details to help tell the story of just what exactly goes on new research suggests that during the initial stages of sleep energy levels increase dramatically in brain regions that are active when we are awake the scientists behind this latest study believe that this surge of cellular energy may replenish the brain is processes that we need to function normally during the day 鈥渆nergy 鈥 by the way refers to atp adenosine triphosphate which is our body is chief energy molecule it is also the same energy currency in other animals like rats which were used in the study the researchers found the following * atp levels increased in four key brain regions that are normally active during wakefulness when the rats were in non rem sleep * during this time however an overall decrease in brain activity occurred * when the animals were awake atp levels remained steady * when the rats were gently nudged to stay awake three or six hours past their normal sleep times there was no increase in atp levels what does all this mean the authors concluded that sleep is necessary for this atp energy surge as keeping the rats awake depriving them of sleep to mimic a sleep deprived human prevented the surge the energy increase may power restorative processes absent during wakefulness because brain cells consume large amounts of energy just to perform daily waking functions indeed there is a lot to do when we are awake in addition to all the tasks we complete consciously think about all the things we do practically subconsciously like breathing think about things we do almost on autopilot surfing the net walking the dog sometimes even driving a familiar route all this activity requires 鈥 you got it 鈥 the atp energy that appears to be produced by a good night is sleep and a good night is sleep is exactly what the doctor ordered to prepare us for the rigors of our day no sleep no energy expended in the brain to help us recover from the day and in essence recharge our minds for the next adventures of the next day it is also worth noting that the precise mechanics of the brain also remain a mystery to some degree there is no doubt that the brain requires a lot of energy to function as the body is master of ceremonies we already know that sleep loss can actually result in brain loss in fact the obligations of the brain may be the only reason we need sleep because without a brain the body is not worth much and it certainly can not do much in addition to food water and oxygen the

large red bump leaking puss on the back of the head my boyfriend has a large bumpgrowthbubble on the back of his head near his neck that has been there for almost 2 years when it first appeared he saw a doctor who told him to ignore it if it does not bother him recently it has started to hurt with pain increasing as the time goes by it has become red and come to a head almost like a pimple and is now leaking a whitish fluid kind of like puss,it sounds like it could be a mild form of staff i had something similar and my doctor gave me pills but another doctor told me to take a bath in plain water and a cap of bleach and after about a week it went away
just to point out my health insurance experience thus far my premiums are significantly higher with less benefits  surprisingly at 3 of 4 level plans only blue cross is listed if the marketplace is touting to be just that why is only one company listed i live in florida could it be that another negative to the website fiasco is that many insurers decided not to participate offering their plans per their websites if there is an inkling of truth to this the issues with the marketplace could be far more reaching than not being able to sign up,plans actually had to make decisions as to whether they would participate in the marketplace this spring and summer well before the website was launched so although the website launch has been a fiasco it is not responsible for the number of plans participating in general rural areas have a much smaller availability of health plans because it is harder for plans to contract with specific providers to form their network so if you live in a rural area there are going to be fewer plans available than in an urban area regardless of the marketplace plans may be hesitant to participate in states using the federal marketplace rather than states that chose to run their own florida is not running its own marketplace

is there a way you can make your period start a few days earlier than the actual date  i want to start today so i can be off by my anniversary next weekend my period is scheduled to start on sunday 102112 but will run into my anniversary weekend because my flow is normally 7 days sounds crazy but i get very uncomfortable during that time of month and i need to be as sane as possible during my anniversary weekend,would not it be great if we could tell our body when to start and stop menstruating i think it would be terrific unfortunately it is not the case there is no way to prompt your uterus to begin shedding its lining because each woman is menstrual cycle usually varies slightly maybe you will get lucky and start early if you feel uncomfortable during that time of the month and you are not allergic to any medications you can try some of the over the counter preparations for menstrual pain and discomfort while a health care provider might be able to prescribe something stronger for diagnosed pms premenstrual syndrome it is obviously too late to get an exam diagnosis and prescription before your anniversary in a week or so i wish i had better news but look on the bright side your periods are regular which a lot of women are sure to envy you for  and you apparently have a great marriage happy anniversary i am a dancer so i often need to make my period come earlier because of date of my concert so i satisfied myself that there are many ways to make your period come faster or even stop it for a day for special event for instance information from this article was very helpful for me <link> i hope it will help you too

what can i do when life feels overwhelming,because the many aspects of our lives are inter related problems in one area often create difficulties in others too for example a husband or wife losing a job generally puts a strain on their marriage that strain can cause tension creating an emotional rift between them if one of them has struggled with overeating alcoholism depression or poor anger management those issues are likely to return and all of this can overflow into problem with children who live within this strained home environment when this happens to you the most important first step after realizing how overwhelmed you feel is to really look at the 鈥榤ountain  what you will see upon closer inspection is that the mountain is not really one big weight it is more like a pile of rocks some of those rocks might be really heavy but they are each much more manageable than the mountain that you previously perceived once you see your problems as a pile of rocks you can begin to sort them from pebbles to boulders tossing out the pebbles is relatively easy is being five minutes late for work because of traffic really worth all that frustration  you can also move many of those rocks off of you if talking to jane at work causes nothing but aggravation you can minimize your interactions with her  the result is that the mountain is no longer so big and unmovable you will also begin to see how to move other rocks that did not seem to budge before so for instance as you begin to lighten your load when your mother makes those critical comments that she so frequently tosses out you will begin to see them as her problem 鈥 not one you need to carry you might still get upset but perhaps less so and you will be able to move past it more quickly

pain all over my body and it is just getting worse what is wrong  i am young about to turn 20 and i had no previous health issues until about 4 months ago i started to experience a pain in my feet that began to spread through my legs and was made worse by exercise i had to see a doctor several times before i saw an exercise physiologist who told me that the tissues in my muscles were not extending like they were supposed to effectively tied in a knot  time went on and now the pain is everywhere it hurts to sit straight lay down what is wrong,unfortunately it would not be possible for me or any medical provider for that matter to be able to offer you a diagnosis blindly over the internet not only do you need to be carefully examined but the doctor will need to take a thorough medical history and order some diagnostic lab tests it would not be possible or prudent to guess what may be causing pain all over your body so you will need to see a medical professional to start the diagnostic process
really irregular period lasting 12days first was light and past days has been brownish why would it last so long never has before also its very light usually heavy period or just light on the last day no change in routine tho am sexually active he pulls out is there a chance i could be pregnant also my period came early and these last couple of days has been more like spotting any suggestions no insurance right now so any advice would help should i wait it out or buy a pg test,okay   first you need to understand that periods can change especially as you get older with more stress more sex ect the brown discharge is probably old blood and seeing as you said it had been 12 days that may explain why it is brown and spotting   and it can last several days after your period pulling out is not a guarantee method of birth control not that i am saying anything else is guaranteed you maybe pregnant some women have their first period after conceiving ovarian cyst are also maybe a possibility and any chance of toxic shock syndrome but chances are it is just an abnormal period if it continues or you start to have pain or new symptoms the only safe bet is to call your obgyn good luck

should non sexually active teens have access to birth control especially when they have severe cramping  many teens often have severe cramping or other symptoms that are really hard to push through sometimes it can hold one is self back from doing many daily things even walking would you consider birth control an effective way of reducing the pain when just applying heat and taking midol or pamprin just is not enough just because teens may need birth control does not always mean the want to be sexually active and some have a hard time telling their parents that think of the health benefits,absolutely i have dozens of teens on birth control who have never been sexually involved hormonal regulation menstrual pain heavyfrequent periods and even severe acne also hormone related are some of the medical indications to use birth control pills teens do have birth control access even without parent permission but when it is for a medical reason and not contraception parents should be involved and supportive really good question the incidence of non sexual teens is probably pretty low in this day and time but yes god bless them it happens i think you have to address the cramping first obviously lots of possible causes again i say you start at the most obvious cause and work your way back to the most obscure with girls cramps are most commonly due to menes blood flowing thru the cervix clots hurt more the cervix which is the distal end of the uterus which extends down into the vag is very sensitive to stuff going thru it dilating it that is why clots hurt more than just thin blood some doctors from my experience over the years have used bc pills to control blood flow down the uterus to the vag i am not a girl but i have been married twice and i have 2 daughters one started her periods at age 8 very cruel joke from mother nature both my wives had endometriosis and had bleeding problems cramps were an everyday occurence so was overflow bleeding geez i felt so bad for my girls nothing prepares a girl for that gone are the days when girls cramps were written off by professionals as nerotic i know it hurts altho some girls tend to be drama queens who actually knows how bad it hurts except them historically bc pills a cocktail of hormones i think seem to reduce blood loss also affects weight gain bigger boobs too fluid retention lovely but my answer to your direct question is if it is bc pills then yes it could help with the cramps and who knows or wants to know if they are sexually active just put them on the pill hope for the best if it does not work with the cramps let them know they should tell you so you can seek other answers parenting is tough especially with girls this is my best answer to be honest my cramps were much less severe and sometimes i never even had cramps while i was on birth control however if you do not truly need birth control i would advise finding another method to control your cramping think about what birth control is and what it does to your body you are literally swallowing one tiny pill that completely changes the mechanics of your body i do not know for sure what types of negative effects they have truly linked to birth control but it all just seems too much to be necessary i do not take any pills if i do

rls or not  for years i have experienced what i always believed to be rls and it has always been managable for the past few weeks though the restless feeling has turned painful and migrated to just my right thigh the pain is excruciating i am perscribed a sleeping aide and it does not even help me sleep through the pain this only comes on at night money is very tight right now and i have been trying to save for a trip to the doctor but honestly i am terrified,although i am sympathetic to your financial constraints the only way that you can be properly diagnosed is to see your medical provider and be properly examined rls does not cause the type of excruciating thigh pain that you are describing so you may need a diagnostic work up when our car breaks down we often have to get it fixed even if money is tight your body deserves the same respect and allocation of your resources you can try calling your doctor    someone who knows you and your medical history    first and explain your problem but i suspect a hands on examination will be recommended

male 70 multiple surgeries 10 surgeries in last 4 years   how do i help him regain his strength and mental abilities  the last knee replaced in february this year accident with tablesaw in early august bladder reopened mid september last day of september entered hospital with uti and severe diarrhea was about to be released with heart rate dropped and consistantly stayed between 32 and 40 beats per minute october 4th heart rate dropped to 28 at rest so pacemaker inserted what steps should i take to help him regain his mental sharpness and energy levels he is impatient that he is not good right now,first check with all his physicians who have been treating him since february and get their ok to start exercising also ask the docter who is treating his heart if he has any restrictions on liftsexercises that use his arms or chest generally patients are not allowed to lift more than 5 pounds after pacemaker insertion for the first several weeks also when you talk to his physicians ask about physical therapy or cardiac rehab due to his extensive list of injuries and illnesses in the past few months a medically managed program might be a better option than home exercise i have pasted some links below that describe what cardiac rehab consists of http<negative_smiley> www webmd comheart diseasetccardiac rehabilitation phases of cardiac rehab http<negative_smiley> www webmd comheart diseasecardiac rehab general exercise guidelines for phase ii <link> after you have gotten all of his physicians clearance to start exercising begin with just a few exercises and increase the time he exercises slowly for example 1 3 times a day have him walk for five minutes around the house if he is having balance issues make sure he uses a cane or walker if one has been prescribed if not walk with him and give assistance as needed 2 1 time a day do the sit to stand exercise have him sit in a chair and stand up then sit back down to increase the intensity you can choose a chair that siits lower to the ground or have him not use his arms if getting out of a chair is a problem decrease the depth by placing a couple of telephone books in the seat of the chair 3 1 time a day do a hip flexion exercise sitting in a chair have him lift his knee and thigh upward about 6 inches to increase the intensity put a handweight or heavy item on his thigh 4 start the sit to stands and hip flexion exercise with 1 set of 5 repetitions and slowly increase both to 3 sets of 10 repetitons meaning have him perform 10 repetitions rest then perform 10 more then rest again and perform 10 more i know this does not sound like much but it is a great place to start the walking will increase his endurance and the 2 strengthening exerices will make it easier for him to get up out of bed and from a chair look for resources in the community is there a silver sneakers program in your town or any programs designed exclusively for individuals in his age group besides the benefits of exercise they also provide a great social outlet

no matter what pair of shoes i wear my heels get dried and flaky looking so what is the cure for this,this is a very common problem and i see it in men and women and especially in the summertime when our heels tend to show more so it is important to hydrate your skin people are great at moisturizing their face but when it gets to their feet they just seem to skip that area so moisturizing really helps and using a product that is what is called a keratolytic so your skin is made up of proteins called keratins and lytic means to break that up so ingredients like urea or lactic acid can help those skin cells become less sticky and will exfoliate them off a little bit better and then moisturizing really helps you can soak your feet in a little bit of water and olive oil for about ten minutes and then when your skin is nice and soft and damp you can put an ointment like aquaphor ointment or even just vaseline or even just crisco oil if you like and then put on a sock to help lock that water in and that will help keep your feet soft and smooth

is it best to exercise first and then eat a full meal or eat a full meal first,there is no best way to do it generally if you get hungry during or after exercise or you feel your energy is running low during the workout then have a snack 30 minutes before the workout carbs and protein like in an energy bar are good if you feel okay during the workout not eating then it is okay some people can eat a full meal before working out but for the most part too much food in the gut will make you feel uncomfortable during the workout again if you run low on energy without food during exercise then have something to eat it is often recommended to not have a full meal at least two hours before exercise though three to four hours is better the reason for this is called blood shunting to put it in simple terms blood shunting is a process where your body diverts more blood to certain areas that need it we have a set amount of blood in our body but the amount that certain areas of your body receive can change at different times the theory is that not eating close to when you exercise will allow for more blood to be delivered to your muscles instead of being partially diverted towards digestion this will allow your body to work more efficiently during exercise to help you get the most out of it you can eat something small right before exercise but be sure to not eat too much if you are exercising in the morning try to have something like a glass of juice a piece of fruit or a slice of toast before exercising so that you have some energy and are not exercising on a completely empty stomach also there is the possibility that eating a heavy meal before exercise may cause you to feel uncomfortable while doing exercise or it may lead to cramps check out this article for more formation

how is sepsis blood poisoning treated,in almost every case of sepsis patients need to be hospitalized treated with appropriate intravenous antibiotics and given therapy to support any organ dysfunction sepsis can quickly cause organ damage and death therapy should not be delayed as statistics suggest as high as a 7 mortality increase per hour if antibiotics are delayed in severe sepsis most cases of sepsis are treated in an intensive care unit of the hospital appropriate antibiotics to treat sepsis are combinations of two or three antibiotics given at the same time most combinations usually include vancomycin to treat many mrsa infections however once the infecting organism is isolated labs can determine which antibiotics are most effective against the organisms and those antibiotics should be used to treat the patient in addition to antibiotics two other major therapeutic interventions organ system support and surgery may be needed first if an organ system needs support the intensive care unit can often provide it for example intubation to support lung function or dialysis to support kidney function secondly surgery may be needed to drain or remove the source of infection amputation of extremities has been done to save some patients lives

hi i have recently undergone a vasectomy and after 1 sample i was asked to do another after putting my second sample in the urologist has asked to see me face to face in 7 days time im not sure if this is normal and i have worked myself up about this thinking they may have detected something in my sample showing something serious like prostate cancer since the procedure i have had little aches and pains in my left testicle which i assumed was normal and may very well be ive also had a bit of a dull ache in my lower left back which comes and goes i may not even notice this for days should i be worried about them calling me in they have not said its urgent or asked me to take someone in is it normal to be asked to see your urologist after a result,semen analysis is not suitable to diagnose prostate ca azoospermia has to be established before declaring sterility this re testing is most likely a part of that very protocol to detect any viable number that could lead to impregnation though vasectomy is very safe method and only 1  failure rate is there retesting at three weeks is ideal to confirm azoospermia wishing you best of health thanks
i have acne and oily skin sunscreens feel really greasy i only wear makeup with sunscreen on my face is that enough,you need to wear sunscreen on any part of the skin that is exposed to the sun oftentimes it can be the fragrance or preservative that is really causing the reaction so if you tend to be sensitive look for ones that are fragrance free and dye free that is a good place to start also apply it a few minutes like 10 15 minutes before you go out in the sun to try to help protect and make sure you reapply it often enough you can do skin testing to see if you truly are allergic to the ingredients i have found that most people are allergic to an ingredient other than the active ingredient in sunscreen those can be avoided in the future so they can still get great sun protection if you really are allergic to the sunscreen ingredient you need to look for sun protective clothing there is clothing that has ultraviolet protection built into it that lasts through multiple washings and you can find these on lots of stores or even online and look for ones that have an ultraviolet protection factor of 30 or higher a regular t shirt only has an spf or upf of about 3 or 8 depending if it is wet or dry so dry has sun protection of about 8 and wet goes down to about 3 so you really need to look for clothing that is sun protected wear a hat with at least a 1 inch brim that is going to cover over your face effectively and try to stay in the shade as much as possible so it is really sun smart behavior put altogether that will protect your skin

could my previous method of birth control affect my fertility,we spend years worrying about unplanned pregnancy fearing that our contraception efforts might fail now that we want to get pregnant we worry that that our contraception efforts may have worked too well could there be long term effects of contraception that might be keeping us from conceiving let is review them briefly and put your mind at ease 1 combined hormonal methods e g birth control pills the patch and the vaginal ring these methods are all similar and do not have any long term impact on fertility we expect your periods to have returned to your normal cycle whatever that means for you within 3 months of stopping all of these methods 2 progesterone only methods the progesterone only pill the 3 month shot the 3 year implant we also expect these methods to wear off in 3 months the shot is a little different in that it is 3 months after the next shot is due since each shot works for 3 months this would be 6 months after the last shot again no long term impact on fertility 3 intrauterine device iud the iuds currently on the market in the us have a wonderful track record with regards to fertility which has not the case years ago with an iud that is no longer available although fertility may be present immediately with either of the two iuds currently available it would be reasonable to expect the progesterone based iud to take about 3 months to clear your system as well 4 diaphragms condoms and spermicides these methods are only effective when you use them so fertility is immediately restored when you do not use them condoms have the additional benefit of protecting against sexually transmitted diseases as well so where are the concerns regarding fertility some of these methods protect wonderfully against pregnancy but offer no protection against sexually transmitted diseases the real villains with respect to fertility for most women the transition from their birth control method to trying for pregnancy should be fairly smooth

dr said that quantity of semen improve over 6 months but not quality is there any hope of pregnancy  when to the doctor 6 months ago after trying to get pregnant it was discovered that poor quality and quantity was the issue i eat healthy exercise most morning and drink average amount of water  6 months later after trying wellman contraceptive the quantity of semen improved but not the quality therefore still disappointed with the news and outcome is there any hope,a lot depends on why your quality is low i think you mean something other than a contraceptive when you talk about this wellman product because contraceptive means that it would prevent pregnancy some men have poor quality sperm if their testes are too warm for too long are you either wearing no underwear or wearing boxers i know you say your diet is good but are you getting a little fat every day and eating plenty of fruits and vegetables and protein you want to find out what is affecting your quality and fix that if you can
i have a very high metabolism and i can not gain weight how can i lower my metabolism while exercising more  i am 20 years old 6 tall and weigh only about 150 155 i am also not very active i want to start running and lifting weights but it is tough for me to gain muscle because i have a very hard time putting on weight what can i do to lower my metabolism enough to start putting on weight and getting bigger i also do not eat very well but tend to eat a descent amount of protein every day,the goal should not be to lower your metabolism but to start feeding yourself better and reap the benefits of activity which can result in muscle gain it does not matter if you get adequate protein if you are missing out on other important nonprotein calories and nutrients that is because inadequate carbohydrate and fat intake total calories means protein is used for energy instead of for muscle formation exercising more can increase your appetite and weight training can gradually help you put on muscle it may take time to see results but because muscle weighs more than fat you are likely to gain weight here are some tips eat regular meals and snacks every day try to plan your meals ahead of time and have items you can put together for quick and healthy meals gradually build a list of balanced meals you can make for yourself include 3 5 food groups at meals including a whole grain lean protein fruits vegetables dairy and healthy fats for example in the morning you might have a big bowl of oatmeal topped with fruit and nuts and a side boiled egg include 2 3 food groups at snack time which may consist of cheese and whole grain crackers or an apple with peanut butter or half a meat sandwich with veggie sticks gradually increase exercise to include cardiovascular exercise and resistance training for tips on how to exercise to build muscle see this article what you may discover during this process is how much better you feel by moving more and eating better you will not regret starting on a healthier road i here this a great deal at the school i teach at if you really want to gain some weight you need to develop a comprehensive nutrition and exercise plan first keep a food diary for three days are you really eating as much as you think when counseling athletes at school i generally recommend they consume 1 8 2 0 grams of protein a day per kilogram of body weight so for you at 150 lbs = 68 kilograms that would put your protein needs in the range of 122  136 grams a day now that you know what your eating and how much protein you need develop an eating plan here is an example breakfast 1 large egg scrambled 1 cup old fashioned oat with one tablespoon honey 1 banana 1 cup skim milk protein in meal = 20 grams lunch 2 grilled chicken breasts 8 ounces 2 cups of veggies broccoli green beans califlower 1 apple 1 serving greek yogurt protein in meal = 69 grams dinner 1 servings baked pork tenderloin 3 ounces remove all fat 2 cups of veggies 1 banana 12 cup fat free cottage cheese protein in meal = 38 grams snacks 1 apple with 2 tablespoons of peanut butter protein 7 grams 14 cup sunflower seed string cheese fruit protein 12 grams total protein for the day = 147 grams

how can i prevent colorectal cancer,the good news for your colon and your rectum is that colorectal cancer is usually preventable the number one way to prevent it is to get screened most men should begin colorectal cancer screening at age 50 if you have colorectal cancer in your family or other risk factors tell your doctor you may need screening at a younger age several screening methods are proven to reduce colorectal cancer rates colonoscopy  you have probably heard of this procedure the downside of it is that a flexible tube about the thickness of a finger is inserted into your anus the plus side is that it can save your life your gastroenterologist gut doctor can usually see and remove polyps or cancer before it spreads if your colon is clean  you probably will not need another colonoscopy for several years flexible sigmoidoscopy  this scaled down version of a colonoscopy is another reasonable option fecal occult blood test  this involves you smearing stool on a paper card and bringing it to your doctor each year your gift is then checked for blood because colorectal cancers often bleed blood in your stool usually earns you a colonoscopy to look for cancer the most recent figures show that the incidence and death rate of colorectal cancer is 35 higher in men than in women also a 2006 study showed that men were more likely to develop polyps and cancer earlier than women therefore early screening may be even more important for men is health some of the other things men can do today to start lowering colorectal cancer risk are eating like a hunter gatherer not a caveman cut back on the red meat like burgers and steaks instead fill up on more than five servings of fruits and vegetables a day these changes alone could reduce your risk by about 50 getting off the couch active men get less colorectal cancer the american cancer society recommends 30 minutes of activity five days a week quitting smoking and limit drinking keep alcohol to one or two drinks a day
how does a messy bedroom affect my sleep,believe it or not when you walk into a room what your eye sees can actually determine whether or not you are going to have an easy time falling asleep or a bad time so the first thing i tell people to do is clean up your bedroom get the clutter out because it is pretty hard to fall asleep with a stack of laundry over here and a big pile of books over there and a very sort of jumbled night table okay and so i talk to them about cleaning up the clutter getting that stuff out of the way so that when you walk in you are more peaceful more serene surrounding that may also have to do with color so there are studies that look at what is the color of your bedroom and how can that affect your ability to fall asleep it turned out that the color itself is not important but the hue of the color is so the brightness of that color turns out to be a big factor so when you are painting your bedroom you do not want a high gloss finish you want more of a matted finish now granted a very bright yellow is probably not a great place to fall asleep but a more muted yellow probably is so again it may not matter the color so much as the brightness of that color

can you get genital herpes from a pelvic exam  i have been married for 19 years and we even use a condom when having sex we both have always been healthy i recently had a pap smear done and on that same day felt very swollen in my vagina the next day we tried to have sex but it was too painful and couldnt then i noticed a bump followed by by more bumps and high fevers the following few days the bumps turned into sores they checked me and said it is herpes could i have gotten from the tools they used to check me,that would be highly unlikely since those tools a vaginal speculum would need to be unwashed unsterilized and still wet from a previous patient that had genital herpes most vaginal speculums are not plastic disposable ones many clinicians still use metal ones but these must be autoclaved sterilized before any subsequent use make sure your diagnosis of herpes is laboratory confirmed not just by clinical observation before you let your mind run amok while it is not uncommon for a married man to stray and have sex with someone else you need to make sure the diagnosis is correct since genital herpes is almost always sexually transmitted it is normal for you to have concerns

how long afrer sex does a pregnancy test show positvie  we had sex on like august 25 or 26 i took a pregnancy test september 6 and got a positive result took another on september 7 it was positive then another september 8 it was positive is it possible to be pregnant only 2 weeks after sex,depending on what kind of test you used some are very sensitive to the hormone that they measure to determine whether or not you are pregnant and can therefore give a positive reading earlier some can show a positive result at 2 weeks home tests can also give false negatives one common reason is that you are using or reading them incorrectly even if you think that can not possibly be the case make sure you read and carefully follow the directions exactly if you have had that many positive tests you could very likely be pregnant you should schedule an appointment with your doctor who will probably do another urine tests and a blood test to be sure

what can i do about the dark circles under my eyes,hyperpigmentation discoloration or post inflammatory hyperpigmentation pih on your skin can be attributed to a variety of disorders i like to begin with excluding any medical reasons that may result in hyperpigmentation hyperpigmentation may be attributed to renal disease diabetes or peripheral vascular disease pih arises from an acquired excess of pigment related to an inflammatory process such as infection an allergic reaction a reaction to medication or a trauma pih often occurs as a consequence of inflammatory skin disorders including acne drug induced eruptions and eczema once you have excluded medical causes there are multiple options to regain your even skin tone a combination of glycolic acid aha and tretinoin based products    along with a traditional topical skin care regimen    will work for skin brightening hydroquinone based products work well however there are other alternatives such as bearberry kojic acid licorice extract and niacin these compounds will work towards brightening your skin and correcting your skin tone the key is to work with a physician that is very familiar with your skin type and color because incorrect use of these agents can lead to further hypo  or hyperpigmentation i tell my african american patients in particular that in order to get your skin in shape it has to be a gradual process similar to exercising you would not attempt to lift 250 lbs on the first day of your workout this attempt may lead to injuring yourself and disastrous results the same holds true with your skin regimen a gradual approach is always best once you get your melanocytes in shape and under control you can improve your skin tone

pain upper right side abdom and back w naus freq urina no vom no fever no gallbladder on ibs pain meds daily appendix,sooboob i have got the same symptoms & spent a week in one hospital & a week later a week at another hospital while dr s were trying to figure out what was causing the extreme nausea that was sooo forceful it made me dry heave but never a true vomiting the only thing they found after extensive examining with every kind of mri ultrasound ct scan & lab u can think of was a golfball size tumor in the center of my liver i have read several threads of people with tumors in their liver that claim to have the same symptoms & their dr would never attribute the symptoms to the tumor i had my gallbladder removed 2 yrs ago & started having the nausea april of last yr & the pain started as an occasional pain similar to the gallbladder pain but grew in intensity & frequency over a several month period i am a woman & notice that the pain is at it is peek a week before my cycle starts pms & during my cycle then it subsides to tolerable & the nausea increases to intolerable they take turns ruining my day lol hope this is not what is wrong with u but your symptoms are the same as mine & all the dr is i have seen are too eager to hand me the ibs med & nexium however the meds make the pain worse
pap smear test painful i have fear of going to the gynecologist because the pap smear test always hurt i can not open my legs as much due to problems with my hip and as a result i am not totally relaxed during this test and when the doctor puts the hand inside to touch my cervix it hurts and i bleed afterwards what should the doctor do to make the exam much better,some clinicians are just more gentle than others for women i would suggest a female provider md pa or nurse practitioner not that men cannot be gentle i am a man but a woman provider should be much more sympathetic to your concerns make the appointment and then call them personally a day or so before your exam to discuss your concerns knowing that you have had a bad experience in the past should make them more understanding take their time and make this important exam less stressful for you a small amount of bleeding can be expected with a pap sometimes but certainly the clinician can be a bit more gentle with the bimanual examination when feeling your uterus cervix and ovarian areas

what is the best way to stop hormone replacement therapy,once you and your clinician have decided that it is time to stop what is the best approach the simple answer is that we do not know formal studies to evaluate this question have failed to show that either going cold turkey or tapering off is better so the choice is really yours the important thing is to know that women in general have about a 5050 chance of experiencing hot flashes again although maybe not as severe as initially after stopping some studies suggest that symptoms peak within 3 months after stopping hormones after you stop take some time to evaluate how you feel before beginning any new medication so you do not get the two effects confused there are a couple of other things to keep an eye on once you have stopped ht if you develop vaginal dryness or recurrent urinary tract infections ask your clinician about vaginal estrogens nonhormonal lubricants and moisturizers can also help with dryness and you might want to ask about a bone density test we know that women who stop ht often lose bone depending on your bone density score and risk profile you might be a candidate for an osteoporosis drug bone sparing at any rate discuss calcium and vitamin d supplements weight bearing exercise and fall prevention with your clinician another good idea is to have your cholesterol rechecked in about 3 months after stopping ht because hormones can affect lipid levels both good and bad and if you are taking a thyroid medication for an underactive thyroid your dose might need to be adjusted thanks for your reply

i have tried self tanners but they streak and leave dark splotches on my skin some of them also smell funny help,it is important to start with skin that is smooth and exfoliated so the first thing you should do is take a shower and exfoliate really well especially over thicker skin area such as the elbows knees and ankles once you have done that you can even moisturize to have your skin well hydrated a lot of the newer self tanners come with moisturizers in them already when you apply the self tanner you can apply it in smooth strokes and skip the elbows knees and ankles until the very end and then just brush it on there you can even take a towel and wipe it off there because areas that are thicker will absorb more of the product the newer products also come with ingredients that make them less likely to streak and with fragrance that make them less likely to have that awful smell that the older products did i also recommend using one that is a shade lighter because they come in several different tones use one that is a shade lighter than the one you think you might start with so if you think you would want a medium start with a light and put it on in layers over a few hours over the course of the day in order to get to the color that you want and then you can just reapply it once a day to maintain that color

should i wake my baby for feedings,i do not recommend waking babies for nighttime feedings because you want them to sleep however i would suggest you wake them for night feedings in their first couple of weeks if they have not yet gained back their birth weight babies tend to lose 10 of their weight after they are born also if they are sleeping more in the day than the night i do suggest waking them so they do not go more than four hours without eating overall i suggest not waking babies at night so they can find their own sleep schedule and you generally do not have to wake them in the day either because most will wake on their own if you notice that the baby is sleeping for longer stretches during the day then i would start waking them in the day so they do not get night and day mixed up

if i got my wife pregnant right before she tested to see if she was ovulating would the test show positive  my wife and i had sex the day before she usually tests to see if she is ovulating she took the test two days straight and no ovulation what could explain this she also said that her stomach had been feeling weird since we had intercourse could she be showing signs of pregnancy in such a short period of time,trying to get pregnant can be exciting but also frustrating at times your wife would have to ovulate before being able to conceive so conception just before ovulation would not cause her to have a negative ovulation predictor test it is possible that she had not ovulated yet or that she did not ovulate at all that month it is possible that the weird feeling was because she was getting close to ovulating remember that it is important to test for ovulation for at least 7 days midcycle regardless if her period does not start when anticipated then take a pregnancy test remember that 85 of couples trying to conceive will do so in 1 year

could my boyfriend is loud snoring indicate a health problem,the problem you describe with your boyfriend is very common loud snoring occurs in almost 25 of the population by itself snoring is not considered dangerous to health however in about 5 7 of all men and 2 4 of women the snoring is associated with episodes of stopping breathing observed by a bed partner additionally daytime fatigue and sleepiness may be present when these symptoms are present with snoring sleep apnea is a possible diagnosis other features of sleep apnea include headaches high blood pressure and repeated awakenings at night sleep apnea is a serious medical condition and should be treated one of the biggest risk factors for sleep apnea is being overweight however having a small chin small mouth or other variations in the face bones can also increase the risk of sleep apnea treatment of sleep apnea is most often with a cpap machine oral appliances and surgery are alternatives but are not as effective as cpap if you suspect that your boyfriend has sleep apnea observe him while he sleeps and try to determine if he stops breathing you should go with him to his doctor and discuss his snoring and describe what you see when his is sleeping mention his other symptoms as well if his doctor thinks he has sleep apnea tests will likely need to be done your doctor will need to order cpap or other treatments
my 3 week old granddaughter does not eat well or sleep well however she smiles widely when spoken too i saw an episode on mystery diagnosis that seems similar to her it was a while ago and i did not think much of it but i remember them saying the first clue was the happy infant that they were very young and it ended up being a rare and i believe neurological disease she does also have problems with her kidney tubes not developed fully and the ped was concerned she was not gaining enough weight in the proper time frame i cant find the episode to find the name of the disease can u help,i believe you are thinking of angelman syndrome however i want to caution you that an infant of just three weeks of age is far too young to diagnose with this condition angelman syndrome is a genetic disorder it is true one of the hallmarks of the disorder is a happy disposition however the main characteristics of this disease are developmental delays learning disabilities the inability to speak and poor coordination of voluntary movements obviously a 3 week old baby is much too young to assess for any of these symptoms a three week old baby is not yet expected to sleep through the night regarding not eating well this is an issue that should be discussed with the baby is pediatrician he or she is in the best position to judge whether or not the baby is getting adequate calories many three week old babies smile when spoken to this is a time to enjoy your grandbaby as she responds to stimulation like being spoken to gently blown on and cuddled try not to jump to the conclusion something is wrong with your grandbaby let the mother and the doctor determine whether or not your little angel is gaining weight and developing appropriately to her age best wishes to you

age limit for colonoscopy test  necessity for 86 year old woman to have test,i believe when a person reaches an advanced age such as age 80 or older that he or she should have a discussion with his or her primary care provider about what screening tests still are necessary to undergo a related question for you is a mammogram necessary at age 86  the answer to your question lies in many individualized factors such as how healthy and robust the 86 year old woman in question is if she is very healthy and active and wishes to remain so then she may choose to undergo a colonoscopy test if she is frail and has many other health problems then she may choose not to undergo colonoscopy the purpose of colonoscopy is to detect precancerous polyps at an early stage in order to remove them colonoscopy is recommended once every 10 years for people at an average risk for colon cancer ultimately if the 86 year old woman in question is of sound mind she is entitled to make her own informed decision about whether or not to have a colonoscopy at her age a medical professional should provide her with an unbiased assessment of the risks and benefits of such a test the rigors and possible side effects of the colonoscopy prep should be discussed i hope this helps

is there absolute minimal daily intake of unsaturated fat in grams or grams per body weight grams not percents im young adult male on strict balanced low calorie diet and i wonder whats the minimal daily intake of unsaturated fat in grams or grams per body weight and not percents the only info i found was that with vlcd some researchers speculated that 15 to 25g of fat will decrease the chance to develop gallstones but on the other hand famous vlcds sold on the market contain less then 10g of total fat a day one contains 6 9g another 4 7g and another 8 4g and theyre popular and considered safe,there is not a minimal recommended amount of unsaturated fatty acids based on body weight the institute of medicine iom does provide adequate intakes for the two essential polyunsaturated fatty acids for males 19 70 year old linoleic acid la    17g per day for males alpha linolenic acid ala    1 6g per day these fats are essential because they cannot be made by the body lower levels would still prevent essential fatty acid deficiency but it is difficult to say how low you could go the question is why would you want to lower your fat intake to such a low level the iom recommends a range of total fat between 20 35 of calories some very low calorie diets vlcd may go below that but that should not occur without a doctor is supervision for more on vlcd see this article it is important to remember that you need fat to absorb fat soluble vitamins for satiety and satisfaction and to obtain other important fats such as dha and epa from marine sources which are vital for heart and brain health good luck

i had a partial hysterectomy in my 鈥40 is at 51 i have hot flashes mood changes and depression is this is menopause,it sure sounds like you are becoming menopausal one test that would probably help would be to do a blood test to measure your estrogen level estradiol and a hormone called fsh follicle stimulating hormone    made by the pituitary and as the ovaries stop working the pituitary gets working harder to try to stimulate them    and the fsh goes up if you are having bothersome symptoms estrogen would most likely help    and presuming you are basically in good medical health otherwise your health care provider could prescribe it to you another possibility as you mentioned that you were dealing with significant depression would be an ssri type antidepressant    it might well help with your mood and should also help some with hot flashes
what stage is cirrhosis of the liver when the person becomes delusional  we just found out my son in law has cirrhosis of the liver he is currently in the hospital and the doctors are running test they will do a biopsy on monday if he does not have a fever he is currently having periods of being delusional thinking various things are happening when nothing is going on our daughter said this morning that he told the nurses rats where running along the floor,i am sorry for the illness of your brother in law i do not know his medical history and i am not a doctor but i will try to provide you with some information as follows the symptoms as you describe can occur at any stage of liver disease but a diagnosis for the condition is not usually made until acute liver failure occurs sometimes the symptoms appear even when liver disease has not been diagnosed the condition is called hepatic encephalopathy because the liver is damaged and cannot adequately remove toxins from the bloodstream the toxins build up in the body causing confusion fatigue and sometimes hallucinations hepatic encephalopathy can lead to mental deterioration personality changes coma and even death but hepatic encephalopathy may also be reversible through treatments directed at removing the toxins and eliminating protein from the diet patients with hepatic encephalopathy may experience delusions hallucinations or illusions a delusion is a wrong fixed idea such as 鈥渋 am the king of england 鈥 a hallucination occurs when a person perceives something through the senses where there is no actual stimulus an example of a hallucination might be seeing rats running down a blank wall an illusion is a sense oriented defect in which a stimulus is present but incorrectly identified by one of the senses an example of an illusion might be seeing a crack in a wall and believing that it actually a trail of rats summary many times there are no overt symptoms of liver disease during the early stages of liver disease including cirrhosis it is suspected that your brother in law may be in a more advanced stage of liver disease your brother in law appears to be in an acute stage of liver disease that has resulted in toxin build up within the body causing stage 3 hepatic encephalopathy hepatic encephalopathy patients may have a reversal of this condition with efficient and timely medical treatment unfortunately some hepatic encephalopathy patients do not respond to treatment and death may occur i hope that this answer has been helpful and that you and your family remain well during this period of medical uncertainty

can a person with labyrinthitis wear hearing aids  the hearing aids seem to cause me more vertigo and sounds in my ears when i remove them i can not seem to hear clearly with them i spent 5000 for the hearing aids and now i feel they are not working i am 86 but in relatively good health i have had labyrinthitis most of my adult life the hearing is getting worse as i age,see an ear nose and throat ent specialist again    one that specializes in inner ear disorders neuro otologist based on your brief posting i am not sure that you have labyrinthitis which typically does not last all of your adult life i suspect you have something different but that is just a blind guess also see an audiologist    someone who can re test your hearing and see if your hearing assistive device can be improved it should not be causing your vertigo to be worse some forms of hearing loss and vertigo can worsen with age and you may be told at some point that little can be done but at this point you can not just throw in the towel see those specialists and you may have some more patient specific answers
about 5 weeks ago my 40 lb son fell on my left foot i had an x ray done and it showed no broken bones,hi from the history it seems that there may be a ligament injury if not a fracture even though you get a mri done the initial line of management would be a plaster boot so i would suggest you to apply a plaster boot for 3 weeks with complete bed rest and non weight bearing this will heal up the underlying injuries thanks
found a bead size bump under the skin right outside of the anal area what can it be is a little sore this is not the 1st time it has happened i did feel it once before about 2 years ago and the same thing it was sore around the area and in the same spot which is losated to back part of the anal area,most helpful answer without being able to examine the area it sounds like either a hemorrhoid or possibly an abscess however your doctor needs to examine you to exactly determine what it is in addition to the bump a hemorrhoid is often itchy it is typically caused by constipation or having to strain more when having a bowel movement they are not typically sore but can be especially if they get inflamed however an abscess is more likely to be tender as it is a bacterial infection with a build up of pus in the area i have included a couple of links above to help you learn more about both of these conditions you need to determine exactly what is causing it by seeing your doctor in order to know how to treat it it could be one of these conditions or something else

how do i sort through all the different health insurance plans to find the one best for me,figuring out which insurance plan will best meet your health needs for the coming year is far from simple if you get your insurance through an employer you will likely be given a few plan options from which to choose if you buy insurance in the private market you can search for plans available in your area and compare the benefits side by side at either healthcare gov or ehealthinsurance com when evaluating each plan take the following factors into consideration do the math estimating what your out of pocket costs will be over the course of the next year is one of the most important considerations when choosing a health plan that means calculating the cost of items such as expected deductibles co pays co insurance and prescriptions once you have added the numbers ask yourself is it cheaper to purchase a high deductible plan with a lower monthly premium that costs me more before benefits kick in or do i see a doctor frequently enough to make it worth my while to pay more each month for a plan that covers costs right away for each doctor visit or treatment also factor in your worst case scenario what will your maximum financial exposure be if you get sick and need serious medical care most insurers offer plan modeling tools on their web site to help you factor in how many times you typically see a doctor during the year how many prescriptions you take and whether you are planning a surgery to help you figure out what your total out of pocket costs might be and which plan options might best serve you review covered services if you are planning to become pregnant and your plan does not cover maternity care a common situation in the private market you will be left with a hefty bill upon baby is arrival carefully check out the list of excluded benefits in the health plan summary if in doubt call the insurance company directly to confirm that the type of care and services you require are covered under the plan you are considering provider networks and drug formularies is your doctor in the network are the three medications you take each month listed in the health plan is formulary if not you are in for sticker shock provider network and drug formulary information should be listed in the summary plan description or you can check the insurer is web site for that information if you are searching for insurance on your own ehealthinsurance com offers an option whereby you can type in your doctor is name to see if she or he is in a health plan is network you might also want to call your doctors directly to confirm participation

do dna skin repair products really work,up until fairly recently the only way to reverse sun damage was to have laser treatments chemical peels or use retinols and prescription tretinoin creams a revolutionary innovation in the cosmeceutical industry is changing that now all you may need to do is go to your drugstore or department store and look for products that contain dna repair ingredients these ingredients now come in every product imaginable 鈥 creams lotions serums sunscreens and here is the wonderful thing they really do work dna skin repair ingredients are usually based on enzymes derived from a variety of sources including plankton and plants most of the major skin care companies are already selling dna repair products and are closely following the new research all these products seem to improve the skin so it is not necessary to buy the most expensive one these enzymes work by restoring dna that has been damaged by free radicals most often caused by sun exposure pollution and other environmental factors dna damage is what causes sagging wrinkles and rough textured skin in other words it is what makes you look old dna repair products do not seem to fade brown spots though and though they soften fine lines they will not have the dramatic effect of botox or hyaluronic acid fillers that plump deep creases still people really notice a difference after a few weeks of using these products and they are usually happy with the results one of the advantages of most dna repair products is that unlike tretinoin and retinols which should only be used at night they do not interact with sunlight and can be used during the day in fact a few sunscreens already include dna repair ingredients although the research is still coming in this may be the wave of the future in sun protection

where do doctors and nurses find out about using medicines during pregnancy,doctors and nurses get information from medicine labels and packages textbooks and research journals they also share knowledge with other doctors and nurses and talk to the people who make and sell medicines the food and drug administration fda is the part of the u s government that controls the medicines that can and can not be sold in the u s the fda lets a company sell a medicine in the u s if it is safe to use and works for a certain problem companies that make medicines usually have to show fda doctors and scientists whether birth defects or other problems occur in baby animals when the medicine is given to pregnant animals most of the time drugs are not studied in pregnant women the fda works with the drug companies to make clear and complete labels but in most cases there is not much information about how a medicine affects pregnant women and their growing babies many prescription medicine labels include the results of studies done in pregnant animals but a medicine does not always affect growing humans and animals in the same way here is an example a medicine is given to pregnant rats if the medicine causes problems in some of the rat babies it may or may not cause problems in human babies if there are no problems in the rat babies it does not prove that the medicine will not cause problems in human babies the fda asks for studies in two different kinds of animals this improves the chance that the studies can predict what may happen in pregnant women and their babies there is a lot that fda doctors and scientists do not know about using medicine during pregnancy in a perfect world every medicine label would include helpful information about the medicine is effects on pregnant women and their growing babies unfortunately this is not the case

what if the mammogram is abnormal,do not panic if you are told that your mammogram is abnormal or that there is a spot on your mammogram an abnormal mammogram does not mean you have cancer the overwhelming majority of abnormal mammograms are caused by benign harmless processes in some cases it may just be an area of thicker or more dense breast tissue a cyst or a benign lump such as a fibroadenoma when a mammogram detects a suspicious area the patient may be advised to obtain further mammograms of that area to have an ultrasound or other imaging study of the breast to see a specialist in diseases of the breast this is usually a general surgeon or to have a biopsy performed of the suspicious area a breast biopsy is the removal of a piece of breast tissue for examination under a microscope the biopsy can be performed surgically in which an incision is made and the area removed or it can be done as a stereotactic core biopsy stereotactic core biopsy is a technique of removing samples of the suspicious area without the need for traditional surgery in this technique the doctor with the aid of a special mammography machine and a computer can identify precisely the abnormality in the breast and then obtain very thin core samples of breast tissue with a special needle this biopsy test is done with only a local anesthetic in the area of the needle puncture and is generally painless fortunately most breast biopsies give benign results while mammography is not sufficiently accurate to diagnose or exclude breast cancer alone it is currently the best method available to screen for breast cancer since its more widespread routine use breast cancers are found when they are significantly smaller and more curable more women are surviving breast cancer as a result of mammography and early cancer treatment continued use of routine mammography should be encouraged until a better alternative in breast cancer detection has been found

though my baby is exclusively breastfed why does he fail to thrive,please note that the weight gain of your baby is fine normally birth weight doubles by the age of 6 months which i think it has as for 7 12 months of age the weight is only a very little bit lesser probably because of reflux issues also babies pass stools either 10 to 15 times a day or once in two to three days so i do not think there is constipation i feel that if the baby had any major problems then the child will not be able to become double of birth weight by 7 months of age according to me the child is having a fair amount of weight gain which is slightly on the lower side probably due to the reflux which will go away eventually with age also you can give multivitamins and calcium supplements to help the baby also give mashed foods along with breast milk to the baby for further information consult a paediatrician online   > <link>

which exercises are best for people with osteoporosis,osteoporosis is a disease characterized by loss of bone that increases the risk of fracture particularly in the wrist spine and hip exercise can have a positive effect on bone mineral density and the strength of bone but it is a complicated relationship because of many factors including genetics age gender hormone and menopause status activity level and nutrient deficiencies age applies to everyone when it comes to the effect of exercise on building bone strength in youth the time of peak bone mineral content velocity the time around puberty when bone rapidly forms is an important time for children and early teens to be exercising because 1 research shows that increases in estrogen in girls helps bone form puberty is when estrogen rises and exercise added during this time enhances the effect on bone density 2 research shows that active youth have higher bone density than inactive children 3 research suggests that denser bone formed during childhood may track into adulthood that is if children and teens exercise enough to create denser bones than their sedentary peers then they may have thicker bones as adults as for young adults it is generally believed that peak bone density is reached by the time we reach our late 20s or early 30s and research suggests that athletes in this age group have higher bone mineral density than sedentary individuals for middle aged and older adults bone density decreases by about 5 per decade after the age of 40 some scientists believe that during these times of life it may not be realistic to expect substantial increases in bone density but rather we should expect a reduction or attenuation of the loss of bone that we experience as we age these scientists may be right because there is little evidence that walking weight lifting or any other type of exercise substantially increases bone density in older adults what you can say with some certainty is that active individuals in these age groups do maintain their bone density while their sedentary peers do not and that is a good thing equally important for older adults in terms of osteoporosis is the effect of exercise on the risk of falling when individuals with osteoporosis fall they typically break bones and in fact sometimes the bones are so brittle that they break before the person hits the ground for example just stepping off a curb could break a brittle bone in the hip and then the individual falls as a result people fall for many reasons including poor balance poor vision decreased strength and range of motion and cognitive impairments like dementia exercise can not help every factor but studies show that exercises such as balance training e g tai chi leg strengthening and flexibility training e g yoga can reduce the risk of falling in older adults as for which exercises are best for people with osteoporosis the simple answer is 1 weight bearing exercises that cause force on the bones like jogging stair

what causes a searing moving pain throughout my thighs and calfs when sleeping it is after an hour on the eliptical i have chronic leg cramps overnight especially in my right foot where i have hardware from a broken ankle occasionally the cramps turn into a searing moving pain that travels through the muscles making it impossible to stand and walk the cramps out it must be from dehydration after exercise although i do drink powerade zero throughout my workout and at least 15oz of water at night,my opinion it has to do with the fact that you just strenuously exercised the muscles in your legs and with going to bed right after you did not give your muscles proper time to relax with a good stretching period after your workout they are probably cramping and tightening up i would suggest you try to hydrate before during and after your workout and give yourself a good 10 minute stretching cool down before heading to bed

can a women get pregnant after ovulation and while she is having her period,it depends how long after actual ovulation if one knows the actual date of ovulation conception can occur up to 72 hours after ovulation as sperm can live inside the cervix for up to 72 hours under ideal conditions an oocyteegg has at least a 48 hour lifespan after ovulation as you may know the most likely time to conceive is about 14 days before the start of your next period so if one had a regular 28 day cycle ovulation is around day 14 a regular 34 day cycle will have an ovulation around day 20 if one has a regular 24 day cycle ovulation can be as early as cycle day 10 the problem arises among women who have periodsbleeds which are not linked to an ovulation these non ovulatory bleeds can occur randomly as the too thick lining of the uterus begins to shed on its own the woman in this case could have a bleed and then an ovulation anytime thereafter an even more risky scenario would be the women who mistakes bleeding associated with the release of an eggoocyte as a period in that case she could get pregnant from intercourse during her supposed period because she is actually at a very fertile time bottom line getting pregnant during a real period is unlikely  especially if it has been 14 days since ovulation occurred if [there is a concern] do a reliable pregnancy test about two weeks after the date of intercourse a urine test should be reliable around the time of [the] expected period lastly if a woman is really scared about having an unplanned pregnancy the worry can cause her flow to be late  a urine pregnancy test can help resolve any concerns yes

is a low fat diet better for your heart,in recent weeks a study published in the american journal of clinical nutrition tried to solve the controversy once and for all pooled data from twenty plus studies and nearly 350 000 participants and found no difference in the risk of heart disease between people with the lowest and highest intake of saturated fat this is huge it is like telling people that bicycle helmets do not protect them from head injuries or seatbelts do not save lives sure it is not a perfect study some of the research relies on people is recollections of what they ate and it is hard to draw any conclusions about whether there may be some benefit to a low saturated fat diet in older or higher risk populations but we can not ignore such a clear challenge to our way of thinking and hope that it just goes away we need more research more data and more open minds many are calling for a new approach to official dietary recommendations that takes the focus off of pyramids and nutrients like protein and fat and more towards general dietary patterns most people are now in agreement that highly processed foods and refined carbohydrates and sweets are not as good for us as a more plant based diet enriched with whole grains unsaturated fats and animal protein from fish this seems like fact but the cynic might just call it the next wave of conventional wisdom time will tell

why do vicidon make me itch,this sounds like a side effect you should monitor closely sometimes itching can progress into a more severe allergic reaction some opioid pain relievers like vicodin can cause a release of histamine in the body this histamine release causes itching think about the way pollen causes your nose to itch that itching is called a histamine reaction  and you take an antihistamine to make the itching stop the same thing can happen in some people when they take opioid pain relievers you can take an antihistamine with the vicodin to see if that helps stop the itching i would recommend you speak to your care provider to see if you should stop the vicodin and take something else of course if you experience swelling of the face tongue or throat along with the itching you should seek emergency medical attention these can be symptoms of a life threatening allergic reaction itching is a not uncommon side effect from opioid pain relievers in my experience but keep an eye on your symptoms anyway wishing you well

do you have any information about why a child female age <positive_smiley> does not wipe her butt when she poops,that is a difficult question to answer not knowing anything about this child addressing a child is hygiene habits or lack of is difficult some parents but important nonetheless especially if you are the one doing the laundry have a sit down talk about the importance of bathroom hygiene not just for cleanliness and odor but for medical reasons stool left on the skin will tend to burn if she already has irritated skin this could be the reason she does not want to wipe now give her some hydrocortisone ointment andor a good barrier cream used for diaper rashes to soothe these sore areas she is old enough to help with the laundry so it may be wise to have her wash her own underwear pointing out that if she wiped better they would be easier to clean buy her some new undies some really nice ones but only give them to her when this behavioral problem has been finally solved be persistent in your efforts but do not punish often it is best to reward for good or expected behaviors than to overly punish or embarrass a child for unacceptable behavior

my aunt steals pain killers and she is bipolar does bipolar cause her to steal  she is in her mid to late fourties she claims she dosent steal pain killers but we have all seen her do it now her sister claims that she steals the pain killers due to her being bipolar i am wondering if this is in fact true or that her sister is just denying it to herself which in turn is not able to get her the help she needs,in the manic phase the person can tend to act impulsivelypartake in unpremeditated risky behavior that they normally would not so therefore its possible that cheating and stealing are something that occur when she is in the manic swing of it but it is no excuse to liecheatsteal there are some people who are bipolar but would never cheat or steal but they would drive their car recklessly etc call her doctor and express the things that are going on i am sure heshe would be a good help bipolar disorder is about moods lying cheating stealing is about their character she has probably done it for so long that her bi polar disorder is a good excuse to get her out of tough situations like this one

i got the explanon birth control and sex immediately after am i protected from pregnancy  i got the nexplanon implanted in my arm on the 5th or 6th day of my menstral cycle i was told by my doctor that because it was the first five days of my cycle i was immediately protected i immediately had unprotected sex about 4 days after implant and have been having unprotected sex with my spouse frequently up until i read the pamphlet they sent home with me that clearly states to abstain from sex for 1 2 weeks any possible outcome of pregnancy,hi any info on this implant seems to be about the implant it self and what to do if it goes wrong and some small bits just like the bc pill using condoms for the first 7 days as a backup all you can do is wait and see just hope things will be ok if you was on the bc pill for over a year then you may still have been safe as it tends to keep working for a few days hope this helps you good luck
my doctor put me on birth control because i have a hormonal imbalance how can i get pregnant with a hormone imbalance  i have stopped taking the birth control pills because i want to get pregnant however i am having my period every two weeks now,hi this a piece of info i extracted from a piece about two periods a month ok the info come from ivillage another reasons for twice a month periods is abnormal thickening of the uterine lining this thickening can be due to hormonal imbalance or to taking estrogen without a progesterone medication as well estrogen causes the uterine lining to proliferate and become thick and lush while progesterone thins out the lining a balance between these two hormones is necessary to ensure regular moderate periods so it may not be as easy as i write but if you get a hormone test done from this it would tell you which hormone is out of whack it then would be to get them back on track by adjusting them in my mind it should work try seeing an obstetrician perhaps heshe will understand this and make it work they must have seen it before do hope this helps you good luck

can u stop growing at the age of 14  hello i am concerned for my sons height he is currently 14 and about 54 height in feet i would say he has hit puberty but recently he has seemed to stop growing as much as he did last year which is worrying me is this normal,the height that a person achieves is primarily genetically determined every normally healthy person will stop growing at some point some as early as 14 usually girls and some in later teen years usually boys the only way to know if growth has stopped is to see an endocrinologist and have an x ray exam to check the status of his growth plates and perhaps his human growth hormone level the bone age test will not show if his growth velocity has slowed down or is slowing down however

why is my clitoral hood turning dark almost black in a strange pattern very sore to the touch and has no bump  i have had an open kind of hood since i was born where i can see the clitoral glans just by looking down at it now the entire area of the clitoral hood is turning black not raised like a mole but more like broken blood vessels in a flat large unpatterned area not a circle not a bump it hurts all of the time but especially when i touch it it does not hurt to go pee,i am sorry you are experiencing this i do not know what is causing this situation but i would have it checked out if i were you especially because you obviously have concerns about it i would too it could be something minor but then again you may have injured that delicate tissue somehow if that is the case a gynecologist can tell you if it needs to be treated i would recommend calling today for an appointment with your gyn to find out what is going on i wish you all the best
8mos old son had a fever for 4 days used ibuprofen & it is now gone but he is constantly fussy which is not his norm  a week ago my son had a fever when i got home from work we used acetamenophen and ibuprofen to treat it had more success with the ibuprofen during the 4 days he had his fever he was miserable did not eat well or sleep well which is to be expected now the fever is gone and he is still miserable   we returned to the md to see if he had something going on like & ear infection & were told he is fine   before this he was my happy little guy &now he is miserable and fussy no matter what we do,finding the reason or reasons why a child is fussy is always a clinical challenge it could be teething remember that you can treat the misery with ibuprofen he does not have to have a fever to use it if his mood improves after a dose of ibuprofen you may have fixed the problem children get tummy aches headaches backaches or get in crabby moods the only problem is that they can not tell us make sure he is using all of his limbs especially his arms eight month olds can get accidental elbow dislocations if you pick them up by their arms check for diaper rashes and make sure he is eating and hydrating well

well i was power lifting and the bar came down wrong and my wrist popped it hurt a whole lot for a couple days then it went away that is until i lift something even a gallon of milk it hurts the same area as original injury my coaches said it was a sprain yet its been three weeks and still hurts if i lift anything my question is is there something more serious to blame other than a sprain,the history of hearing a pop indicates a soft tissue rupture tendon or ligament and this should not be taken lightly if there is a complete tear the healing will not be complete and surgery would be needed to have ful limb function it would be recommended that you consult with your doctor and get a mri which would help make a proper assessment of your injury and based on that future mode of management can be determined i hope this helps

i was treated for a penile yeast infection with fluconazole when can i safely have sex with my wife i have a cyst condition which i have been taking an antibiotic for prescribed by my doctor,for a simple penile yeast infection balanitis you can have sex now if you use a condom and your sore penis is up to it otherwise wait until you are symptom free i have no idea what you mean by a cyst condition and which antibiotic you are taking and for why so i would suggest you call your doctor for patient specific advice    someone who knows the details of your case if you do have sex while you are still experiencing a yeast infection make sure that you use a condom however it is often best to try to wait until the yeast infection is gone just to reduce the risk of spreading it it also can sometimes be a little sore on the penis when the yeast infection is in full power  make sure you maintain proper overall penis health by using a quality penis nutrient cream health professionals recommend man1 man oil look for one that includes a superior antioxidant like alpha lipoic acid good luck you could always use a condom but if not wait a few weeks for sure it would not be a bad idea to use an antibacterial penis health creme too i use one called man1 man oil just to be sure things are nice and clean down there because as we all know condoms are always a good idea until you are in the moment hope this helps and good luck
is counting calories the way to lose weight,if you can keep it up counting calories is a pretty good way to lose weight it can be tough for some people to stick to over time however one of the things i like about counting calories is it makes you more aware of portion sizes then even if you stop counting calories you have a better idea of what a normal portion size is portion size is one of our biggest enemies today when it comes to weight control a thousand calories a day may be a bit on the low side generally we do not recommend people go below 1 200 calories per day because that may not give you the energy you need to get throughout the day exercise is such an important part of any weight loss plan and it could be tough getting through a normal day and exercising when you are consuming so few calories you also run the risk of not getting enough of the daily vitamins and minerals you need make sure you are eating plenty of fruits and vegetables and lean proteins lean meat chicken low fat dairy or beans to get the nutrients you need each day

i have an ear infection and am having trouble keeping the drops in my ear they drip out when i sit up i am using ciprodex ear drops as well as antibiotics when i put the drops in my right ear i can not seem to get them in i can sometimes get 1 drop in out of 4 i lay on my side for about 15 mins but when i sit up i can feel them slowly drip out i also tried the drops in my uninfected ear no problem going in is this because of the infection what can i do,there can be several reasons since i can not examine your ear or even know the underlying reason you are using the ciprodex there are several different types of ear infections it is difficult for me to blindly determine a reason one reason could be ear canal swelling in otitis externa the ear canal can nearly swell shut some clinicians will insert a wick in the ear canal to allow those drops to penetrate other reason is a wax impaction or a canal filled with pus or other debris many clinicians will not attempt to clean out the ear when it is painful so if you have a blockage of debris those drops will not go in i would suggest that you consult the clinician currently treating you since they examined you last

single white 14 seed shape on toilet paper after painful bowel movement what is it  i recently had a very painful bowel movement i have struggled with constipation since birth upon wiping there was a sesame shaped spot on my toilet paper but it was about 14 in length i have been eating sesame stix lately could it just be a bloated seed or could it be a parasite i crushed it between the toilet paper and it was waxygel like i have also been eating organic produce lately in which i found a tiny caterpillar on the celery some grapes had black chunks in them i didnt eat those,based solely on your description and the information in your posting i would guess that this was just an undigested seed many seeds will pass through the gi tract and emerge like this i do not think this was a parasite or have anything to do with that caterpillar on the celery i suspect this may be the list time you see these things unless of course you eat sesame seeds again

can a girl get pregnant from precum the day after her period then taking the morning after pill i had sex with my gf twice this weekend once on sat night and once sun morning i did not use a condom nor did i cum inside of her she just got off her period the day before we had sex i was worried so i had her take the morning after pill she also took the morning after pill last month for the same incident should she be ok not getting pregnant since i didnt cum inside her and she took the pill,use a condom for goodness sake stop playing sexual roulette with your girlfriend you may be fine this time i do not know but it is only a matter of time before she will become pregnant maybe next time viable sperm can be present in seminal fluid and that sperm can remain alive for a week or so while a woman can only become pregnant a few days a month sperm do not understand that many will just wait around hoping that an egg ovum will appear you will sleep better if you keep all of your penile emissions the seminal fluid and your ejaculations well contained in a condom and since you and your girlfriend are clearly having regular sex she could benefit from using an effective form of contraception as well the short answer is yes and no yes she can get pregnant from pre cum and no she cannot get pregnant the day or two after her period ends the long answer is as follows using a condom andor birth control will help keep your minds at ease and are likely your best method for not having an unwanted baby most health departments will offer both at little to no cost if it is true that her period ended on friday then it is highly unlikely that she will become pregnant day after pill or not sperm can live for 24 72 hours in the female body most will die off en route searching for an egg however it only takes one egg and one sperm a woman is cycle works like this period starts and triggers a turn of events the lh phase is the phase when her body is not fertile typically 10 16 days from the day the period starts depending on her specific cycle then the fertile days come in to play for about 4 5 days her body will be in a fertile state but typically it is the last two days of this particular cycle when she is most ready to get pregnant once this phase is over her body prepares to have another period to shed the lining that has built up to accept the pregnancy i would suggest getting an app on her phone that tracks her cycle and her most fertile times of the month mostly because i do not see you two using a condom or birth control no matter how many people tell you that you should at least this way you two will have a better understanding of where her body is at and when its at that point to try and keep from getting pregnant it can take about three months to get the app lined up with her cycle to track the days with the most accuracy please keep in mind that this is for a woman with a normal cycle however even with an abnormal cycle it is highly unlikely to get pregnant within a few days of ending a period this

should i give ipecac to induce vomiting,times past it was recommended that families with children keep a bottle of ipecac on the shelf in case junior ingested something poisonous ipecac will reliably cause vomiting about 20 30 minutes after it is given so the idea was that you could at least get your child to vomit back the poison we know now that advice to keep ipecac handy and use it after poisonous ingestions was wrong though it does cause vomiting that 20 30 minute lag in effectiveness means that in many cases the poison has already been absorbed or has at least traveled beyond the stomach so it can not be brought back up some ingested things cause as much damage on the way out as when they were eaten and vomiting them will only make things worse most importantly drinking ipecac will prevent emergency physicians from being able to use truly effective treatments for ingestion such as activated charcoal or medical antidotes there are current no situations where national poison control centers advice the use of ipecac and the american academy of pediatrics does not recommend parents keep ipecac in their house if you think someone has ingested something poisonous your best next step is to call the nationwide poison control center at 1 800 222 1222 in the us try to have the most important information available to discuss what was ingested when was it ingested who took it and how much was ingested they will tell you what steps to take whether you need to go to the er or what to monitor at home

i am doing a research paper comparing and contrasting exercise and fad diets i cant find benefits and disadvantges there are all types of information on both subjects but i cannot seem to find the right information for my compare and contrast topic of two methods of losing weight i chose exercise and fad dies as the two topics to discuss i have plenty of information on exercise but having a hard time with the fad diet issue i was hoping for some added articles to point me in the right direction,there are certainly many different paths that you can take to eat healthy and there is honestly no one right approach with that said i personally am weary about any diet that is heavily focused on one central theme or ideology i do not think that it is always good to promote only one certain food or completely omit certain food groups altogether we know that some foods are generally better than others but there is still a lot left to learn also a healthy diet should be based on a lifestyle change not something that you follow short term just to promote a certain result a healthy diet is one that you can sustain long term and that does not leave you feeling hungry or feeling deprived so overly restrictive diets are not the answer either lastly a healthy diet is evidence based and not something formulated on personal claims or anecdotes a diet that promises you everything is probably too good to be true if you are looking for more specific examples this site may help <link>

i exercise with a stationary bicycle i have been chaffed in the groin area how do i protect my groin from this,i am an avid biker and there are many solutions that translate from actual road biking to stationary biking first start off by wearing proper clothing yes a good pair or two of biking shorts with padding are just as beneficial on a stationary bike as well as the ones that move also make sure that you clean your shorts after each ride since residual bacteria can cause irritation yes biking shorts are expensive but a couple of good pair makes a huge difference make sure you have a good fitting seat now if you are a health club you cannot change it but if this a home stationary bike you can change the seat not all seats are made the same and since a seat might be large and comfy it does not always translate into being good for reducing chaffing as far as creams or ointments this is where you may have to experiment using petroleum jelly is fine but i would add some shea butter to the mix some people use k y jelly instead and of course there are tons of commercial products like brave soldier which i have used changing riding positions also helps simple changing your lateral position on the seat every now and then you can reduce continuos contact on the seat i hope this helps and keep it up
what would happen is pneumona vac was injection into your arm when it should have been a ppd test  i should have been given a ppd but i think the wrong bottle was picked up and i was given pneumonia vaccine my arm has a red raised spot 1 34 x 1 34 in the area the ppd  was given my arm is very sore the area of redness is now going up above my elbow in a straight line,what should happen that nurse or medical assistant should be retrained other than the inflammation which is obvious there should be no long term residuals i am a bit concerned that you may be having a lymphatic reaction the red streak so you medical provider needs to see this and make sure you do not have a secondary infection from this avoidable mistake do not pay for this extra office visit either you will still need a proper ppd and it should be absolutely free  and if you need the pneumonia vaccine administered properly of course i would insist on a freebee as well

how to increase blood volume in body  lost half of my blood due to a bleeding ulcer got out of hospital with a number of 10 within one month it was up to 11  then slowed down after 4 more months it was 11 4 and finally 2 more months moved it to 11 7 my annual physical blood chemistry says it should be between 13 and 18 i tire easily and feel i am not getting enough oxygen to the brain i feel dizzy and have blurred vision often this does not help since i have an ef of 30 40 thank you,i am sorry you are going through this i think the reason your care providers are not intervening is because your hemoglobin count is rising naturally it has progressed from 10 to 11 7 it may not be rising as quickly as you would like but it is a good sign that the level is coming up on its own as you probably know hemoglobin is the protein on red blood cells that transports oxygen i am assuming you are referring to your hemoglobin number because that is the blood test that most closely fits the reference range of 13 to 18 you are referring to  when hemoglobin levels are low we call it anemia  technically you are anemic you can not increase your blood volume  but you can take steps to help the anemia clear up more quickly eating iron rich foods and fruits that contain vitamin c may help however you should check with your doctor first because excessive iron consumption can hinder the action of some medications specifically green leafy vegetables like spinach should not be eaten if you are taking warfarin coumadin also you must not take iron supplements with antacids and treatment for ulcers frequently involves taking antacids in fact just to be clear i never recommend anyone take an iron supplement without a doctor is supervision it is good news that your hemoglobin numbers are coming up on their own i am sorry it is taking longer than you would like and that you are having unpleasant symptoms wishing you well

are there special risks associated with epilepsy,although most people with epilepsy lead full active lives they are at special risk for two life threatening conditions status epilepticus and sudden unexplained death status epilepticus status epilepticus is a potentially life threatening condition in which a person either has an abnormally prolonged seizure or does not fully regain consciousness between seizures although there is no strict definition for the time at which a seizure turns into status epilepticus most people agree that any seizure lasting longer than 5 minutes should for practical purposes be treated as though it was status epilepticus status epilepticus affects about 195 000 people each year in the united states and results in about 42 000 deaths while people with epilepsy are at an increased risk for status epilepticus about 60 percent of people who develop this condition have no previous seizure history these cases often result from tumors trauma or other problems that affect the brain and may themselves be life threatening while most seizures do not require emergency medical treatment someone with a prolonged seizure lasting more than 5 minutes may be in status epilepticus and should be taken to an emergency room immediately it is important to treat a person with status epilepticus as soon as possible one study showed that 80 percent of people in status epilepticus who received medication within 30 minutes of seizure onset eventually stopped having seizures whereas only 40 percent recovered if 2 hours had passed before they received medication doctors in a hospital setting can treat status epilepticus with several different drugs and can undertake emergency life saving measures such as administering oxygen if necessary people in status epilepticus do not always have severe convulsive seizures instead they may have repeated or prolonged nonconvulsive seizures this type of status epilepticus may appear as a sustained episode of confusion or agitation in someone who does not ordinarily have that kind of mental impairment while this type of episode may not seem as severe as convulsive status epilepticus it should still be treated as an emergency sudden unexplained death for reasons that are poorly understood people with epilepsy have an increased risk of dying suddenly for no discernible reason this condition called sudden unexplained death can occur in people without epilepsy but epilepsy increases the risk about two fold researchers are still unsure why sudden unexplained death occurs one study suggested that use of more than two anticonvulsant drugs may be a risk factor however it is not clear whether the use of multiple drugs causes the sudden death or whether people

will abdominal injections of heperin affect my bladder muscles  in hospital 1 5 days subject to four or five heperin injections in abdomen urination painfuldifficult now,most helpful answer i am sorry to hear you are going through this it sounds distressing i have never heard of heparin causing side effects with urination but that does not mean it is impossible heparin can cause abdominal pain and so it is possible the symptoms you describe could be related to the medication you do not say how long ago you were discharged from the hospital or why you were there to begin with i want to point out many things other than heparin could cause the symptoms you describe for example if you had a foley catheter inserted to drain urine from your bladder this can be a source of painful urination for a while after it is removed abdominal surgery including laparascopic surgery can cause abdominal pain and feelings of difficulty urinating most of these side effects go away after hours or at most days after hospital discharge though all of that said if you continue to have difficulty urinating and if your bladder becomes hard and distended you can feel it by pushing gently with the flat of your hand above your pubic bone you should seek urgent medical attention wishing you well

is it common to have a resident in a caesarean  hi  my wife had a caesarean there were two doctors that performed the operation that lasted nearly for an hour in addition to an experienced md there was a resident doctor should this be acceptable  to be honest i was initially terrified because the operation sounded like a training session i could hear the experienced doctor giving instructions to the resident  thanks,residents are doctors getting advanced training in obstetrics in order to learn by observing and participating they need to do those procedures your hospital is most likely a teaching hospital that has many residents in many different specialty area instead of seeing this as a training session view it as you had two doctors for the price of one one highly experienced and another in training two heads and four hands are always better than one head and two hands

how wrinkled should i be before i consider a peel,when she looks into the mirror a lady decides whether she is happy or unhappy with the state of her skin and when she sees the vertical lips lines and maybe the deep lines around the crow is foot area and some frown lines here and some forehead lines at some point she is going to ask herself well should i do something about it now she could use an entry level procedure like botox that will help the squint lines it is very good for the vertical frown lines but it does not change the overall characteristics of the skin when there has been a lot of sun damage that brown color the kind of an unhealthy look sun damage brown spots age spots whatever you want to call them it would take a resurfacing the removal of that damaged layer of skin and forcing nature to regenerate fresh new skin and that is really what the chemical peel or the laser peel does so some patients may need a little help with restylane a little help with botox a lot of help with the chemical or laser treatment when you look in the mirror you decide what you do not like and then you have to consult with a specialist who will tell you what the remedies are and for some people treatment a is not proper and for others it is and that is the value of the consultation only if it is really bothering you a lot i mean everybody everybody has kind of a tipping point there is a point where one day you look in the mirror and you say you know what i know it is not going to get any better i think i need to talk to a doctor about this and that age could be 40 it could be 65 and people have come in here to consult for the first time with a cosmetic surgeon at 75 or 80 my first question is where have you been no but whatever is right for the patient is what counts it is all in the eyes of the beholder if you see you are starting to wrinkle should you rush in in your 40s and 50s we are here to serve when appropriate at any age now does the chemical peel do any kind of lifting  in fact it does not correct the jowls or the sagging neck but a lift in the sense that it does tighten the skin on the face it will make this groove a little better not enough perhaps to solve the problem completely but what it does is it gives you a youthful looking skin because it is not wrinkled it does not have the age spots does not have the brown spots does not look like you have baked in the sun and that is something that no other process obtains

does a person get a high from capsule medical marijuana does it dull pain or just make the pain tolerable  could this help a 95 year old who is in severe pain from spinal stenosis and arthritis does it really have any long term effects on memory,i would be reluctant to use medical marijuana on an elderly person who may have problems with memory and mental processing as it is however a pain managment specialist may have different ideas this 95 year old should really see a pain specialist so that hisher pain can be pharmaceutically managed taking into account all of there medical history personally i have never prescribed it for these reasons as a former pain pill addict and current medicinal user of cannabis i must respectfully disagree with the doctor new research is showing that marijuana does not effect the memory in the ways previously thought however i will admit the effects of marijuana on an elderly patient especially one that has never used it before may be a bit overwhelming are you in a state where it is legal medicinally because it would be best to do under the care of a doctor considering the age factor marijuana is a much safer form of pain control than traditional narcotics it is also being shown to have benefits on numerous other conditions you can always do the research if you have any doubts or concerns also to answer your original question marijuana does not come in pill form there is a synthetic pill called marinol but it is not exactly the same as cannabis and is usually only prescribed for cancer patients there is a variety of ways to reap the benefits of marijuana i would suggest cannabis oil a little bit placed under the tongue can go along way there is also edibles such as cookies cakes and brownies but those tend to have a more psychoactive effect and may be a bit too overwhelming smoking it is an option but with the patients age i would advice against this if you are in a state where it is legalized for medicinal use talk with a doctor about your options if unfortunately your in a state like me where its not you can always find all the information you could ever want or need online just be careful and make sure you check the sources of the information your reading also be careful of the law as i can personally attest to even if your just trying to use a safe alternate to treat your pain they will still treat you like a criminal order 100 legit n safe medical marijuana pain relievers cbd oils dabs and more for more info text 505 807 7504 lisanblakeretailshop@gmail com medical marijuana is good for your health top medical strains for all patients suffering from depression glaucoma anxiety and tension headaches chronic pain and nausea mental and physical fatigue and for calming aromatherapy then you are in the right place to look in our meds all top grade aa+ with high level of cbd and thc contact for your supply and good health pain killers medical marijuana act lean *** no prescribtion is needed bud seeds harsh oils dabs & other m m treatments we

what is osteoarthritis,osteoarthritis or degenerative joint disease is the most common type of arthritis it is associated with the breakdown of a joint is cartilage cartilage is a firm rubbery material that covers and cushions the ends of bones in normal joints its main function is to reduce friction in the joints and serve as a shock absorber  osteoarthritis causes the cartilage in a joint to become stiff and lose its elasticity making it more susceptible to damage over time the cartilage may wear away in some areas greatly decreasing its ability to act as a shock absorber as the cartilage wears away tendons and ligaments stretch causing pain if the condition worsens the bones could rub against each other causing even more pain and loss of movement oa is most common in middle aged and older people and its symptoms can range from very mild to very severe the disorder most often affects hands and weight bearing joints such as knees hips feet and the back but can affect almost any joint in the body women are more commonly affected than men
to dr moser i hope you read this thank you for answering my question some more information would be appreciated it was a staph infection that was in his testicle area i know the needle would have hurt but should he have felt much more after that it was a min or less that the dr waited before he started to lance the infected area it was a very small incision that he made no bigger than the tip of a pen,most helpful answer a staph infection in the testicle area is painful in itself let alone have an abscess surgically lanced i have done this procedure on a number of patients and as careful as i am to limit discomfort there is still pain involved just using lidocaine in this area is painful to inject and often very difficult to even use many abscesses have just a thin layer of skin over them in order to numb this area the lidocaine has to be injected in the skin not underneath in the pocket of pus this can be very difficult sometimes just a quick puncture using a sterile scalpel is less painful that trying to numb up this challenging area hopefully you are on the proper antibiotic and treatment regime and better by now if the staph infection was caused by shaving you may want to consider going back to au natural again
i am 58 and weigh only 130 but i have a 30 inch waist why does my fat all go to my belly,yours is a common cry heard from women who tend to deposit their body fat in their abdominal area first you are not obese we have to keep these measurements in perspective look at the other women on both sides of your family do some of them have the same fat distribution genetics does play a role your waist size is very good at 30 inches but may seem to be large in your eyes because the rest of you is so much smaller in comparison most women would love to have a 30 inch waist just as an aside ask your gynecologist to check you for ovarian cysts sometimes women have polycystic ovaries that lead to a greater abdominal fat distribution there is a simple sonogram and blood test you would undergo if you do not have this issue then you are left with your genetics some women simply have more active fat storage enzyme in their abdominal area others bemoan the fact that they have it mostly in their buttocks or thighs everyone is different here here are some tips to optimize your waistline 1 watch out with overconsumption of alcohol it tends to favor ab fat distribution moderation please 2 eating too many breads pastas and heavy complex carbs bloats most women esp in the ab area 3 watch your posture if you are tall hey i am 59 so i know  and you stoop over that will make your tummy look large to you and the world straighten up and practice good core power throughout the day 4 speaking of core i would most definitely do a core program including pilates you need to keep that long waist and back strong and toned 5 try to keep your calories spread out over the day eating too much late at night leads to a tummy hang in the morning
cervix looks like a skinned knee today i went to the gyno for concerns i was having with my birth control she did a pap and said my cervix looked like a scrapped knee then she took a sample and i started bleeding very bad she told me its probably nothing but she took some tests i am very nervous now and i can not stop worrying   anyone had a similar experiance   p s i also recently had sex about 6 days ago and i cramped so bad and started bleeding this has never happened before during sex,the cervix can become friable and bleed for many different reasons so i am sorry that your gyn did not explain it to you at the time of your pap i can understand your anxiety since you were sort of left hanging after that comment the most common reason would be cervicitis an infection that obviously involves the cervix and usually the vagina many will simply self resolve but this may also show up on your pap smear when you get the results a small amount of bleeding can occur during a pap and can interfere with results so hopefully you will not have to have a repeat pap smear as you mentioned the cervix can also be traumatized during sex so this may be the underlying reason i think it would be important to have a follow up with your gyn if you continue to have post coital bleeding
what causes stomach pain and swelling after eating every meal been this way for 3 weeks it started out about 3 weeks ago i have stomach pains and severe swelling after i eat then a couple days later i got my period and it seems my swelling is not as bad so i went to the docter and he thought it was my gallbladder i had blood work done normal sent me for ultrasound normal then hida scan normal still having problems everytime i eat my stomach starts hurting really bad and my stomach swells some my stomach is constanly sore ,the next step would be to see a gastoenterlogist   someone that can visually inspect your stomach with a fiberoptic scope or at least run some additional diagnostic tests medications used to block or reduce your stomach acid or an antispasmotic medication taken prior to meals would be one treatment consideration once you are properly diagnosed

i sprained my ankle 7 months ago and still am not 100 7 months ago i slipped on ice outside my driveway and heard a large pop sound when i fell at present day i can walk comfortably i have full range of motion in all directions except upwards meaning if i grab my foot and pull it towards me there is pain inside my ankle in the ligaments that were damaged in the fall i assume i am trying to exercise it by putting half my foot on a raised object like a curb or books and gently push down what can i do to improve the healing process,i sprained my own ankle about 20 years ago and it still hurts unfortunately i waited too long to get a proper diagnosis assuming it was just a sprain i tore some ligaments and because of the delay in having an mri it could not be repaired i suggest that you do not repeat my own mistake and have a proper examination either by an orthopedist or podiatrist that handles ankle disorders you may need some imaging studies as well i am a board certified physical therapist with over 13 years of clinical experience physical therapists are experts in assessing and treating problems with the neuromusculoskeletal system including ankle injuries and sprains i highly recommend that you seek the professional opinion of a well respected physical therapist in your area physical therapists focus their practice on macro biological movement sciences as opposed to micro biological pathology what does that mean to you not only will a pt help you determine if you have 鈥榣oose or possibly 鈥榯orn ankle ligaments but he or she will perform a thorough examination of your entire lower body to determine what is at the root of your continued pain 鈥 often a dysfunctional movement pattern that is due in part to the initial injury but perpetuated by a host of factors if you see a physical therapist you will have an initial examination to determine a 鈥渄ifferential diagnosis鈥 the pt will take a thorough history and screen you to determine if there is a medical condition that requires you to see a physician for further medical workup second the physical therapist will determine a 鈥渕ovement impairment diagnosis鈥 that will help direct physical therapy interventions in your question you state that ankle dorsiflexion moving the foot upwards is limited and painful otherwise you do not state why you are not 鈥100鈥 with limited dorsiflexion some common activities that might be painful are deep squatting running jumping and stairs the great thing about seeing a physical therapist is that he or she will work with you to find the root causes that are driving this continued pain and limited motion we will go beyond treating your symptoms these causes may or may not include things such as joint stiffness scar tissue flexibility restrictions decreased proprioception balance ability and coordinationcontrol muscle weakness and altered biomechanics these impairments can respond very well to conservative physical therapy treatments regarding an earlier answer that was posted mris and surgery are rarely needed even with severe ankle sprains if your injury was more recent and you were having trouble walking x rays might be more highly indicated to rule out possible bony pathology again a physical therapist can safely and effectively guide you in your treatment course even if you require referral for further medical workup even in the case of severe ankle injuries such as fractures that are treated surgically or non surgically i see that patients recover best when physician care is followed by physical therapy rehabilitation in all 50

what are the risks of using carbamide peroxide drops on a perforated eardrum  i initially thought my symptoms might have been due to a build up of earwax i used otc carbamide peroxide in an attempt to clear out any possible blockage i only used it once as it actually increased the sense of fullness in the affected ear which i assume was due to some of the fluid draining into the perforation about a week after using the drops i was properly diagnosed with a perforated eardrum could i have done any damage by using carbamide peroxide drops on my perforated eardrum,probably not but it is good not to do this again if a perforated eardrum is even remotely possible

i gained weight after having my uterus removed now have borderline high blood pressure is this linked to menopause,there are a several important points to consider with your question if your uterus was surgically removed but you still have your ovaries this does not mean that you have reached menopause when the ovaries are left intact following a hysterectomy they may function normally and produce hormones for years to come in which case the absence of menstruation would not mean that you are in menopause or the ovaries may stop hormone production within a year or two after the hysterectomy and lead to an earlier menopause than would normally be expected the relationship of menopause to high blood pressure hypertension is complex and not fully understood however there are some studies that suggest that declining estrogen levels may influence the lining of the blood vessels and contribute to increases in blood pressure researchers continue to review the relationship between menopause and blood pressure you also mention that you have gained weight you do not mention if you are overweight but weight is also related to the risk of hypertension excess body weight is a known risk factor for the development of hypertension and gradual weight gain throughout life has been correlated with the increase in blood pressure that occurs with aging

is it okay to put ice on a burn what about butter or mayonnaise,well the thing is you do not want to put ice on it if you put ice on it believe it or not the burn is kind of open skin in some cases so ice will actually adhere to the skin so when you try to take the ice off of it you will rip layers of skin with it and possibly cause an infection the recommendation is really to use tepid or cool water not super cold but right in the middle and submerse the area butter and mayonnaise to me are like wives tales people believe that they should be putting some type of ointment on it to help replace the moisture in the skin that is not the case we found out in a lot of cases now that you need to let the air get to it and let it heal by itself because when they were putting things like ointments and creams on it it was trapping in bacteria leading to skin infections if you notice though it is blistering and the area is extremely red you probably need to go and have it looked at by a healthcare provider because there are some prescription ointments and creams that are specifically used for burns

can a cold sore give me genital herpes  recently my girlfriend gave me a blowjob she had a cold sore on her lower lip although the sore was completely scabbed over and is almost completely healed she got it two weeks ago and has been using some type of medicine to get it healed the bj lasted 15 seconds and the scab barely touched my penis the sore is not open at all so is there still a high risk of infection whenever we make out when she has a cold sore i never get one and she generally gets them when she is really stressed,the short answer is yes unfortunately you have exposed yourself to genital herpes it does not matter that the cold sore was scabbed over or that the lip lesion barely touched your penis a person with herpes can spread the virus even when it is not active your girlfriend is herpes most definitely was active since she had a lesion this does not mean you positively will develop genital herpes but you are flirting with disaster you need to take better precautions in the future there is no cure for genital herpes if you do develop genital herpes you absolutely must disclose the fact to your partners before you have sex with them they have a right to decide whether or not to risk getting the virus from you and while condom use is good be aware a condom will not necessarily protect you from herpes because the virus can reside in groin areas that are not covered by the sheath i am not sure how old you are but you may want to read this article about the rise in genital herpes transmission among us teens due to having oral sex with an infected partner even if you are not a teenager the same scenario applies to your story please stop engaging in unsafe sex always use a condom do not have any type of sexual relations with a person who obviously has a virus that can become a sexually transmitted disease you owe it to yourself and your sexual partners to be responsible about your sexual practices wishing you well there r two types of herpes there r the oral kind and then there is genital kind yes u can get herpes on your genitals from a cold sore but even tho it is herpes on your genitals it is not actually the genital type of herpes it is the oral type actually u can spread each type to each area yes her giving u head with a what looks like mainly healed sore can give u herpes i have kissed a chick with a sore before to and did not get nothing some times your just lucky or perhaps your immune system is working harder and better at times i do not know but u can get on acyclovir twice a day from your doctor it is herpes meds or if u do not have insurance there is a natural pill for it u can get at health stores or what have u called l lysine and take it twice a day and have her take it as well hell even once a day would b good

are there new and effective hepatitis c treatments in development,not one but two effective new hep c treatments got a strong endorsement from an fda advisory panel merck is victrelis boceprevir was recently approved and vertex is telaprevir no brand name yet should soon get full fda approval about two thirds of people are cured when either of the new drugs is added to current treatment the telaprevir combination takes six months 鈥 half the time of current treatment 鈥 while victrelis treatment lasts eight to 12 months as usual in the world of hepatitis c treatment there are serious downsides to both drugs the biggest downside is that people who take them still have to take the standard treatment of alpha interferon and ribavirin taking these drugs is like having a bad case of the flu that lasts for months unfortunately the combination of standard treatment with either of the new drugs is even harder to take each drug adds to the anemia from the interferonribavirin combo some 40 of people taking victrelis get so anemic they need expensive doses of the anti anemia drug erythropoietin and a nasty rash is a common side effect with telaprevir the two drugs work in essentially the same way both are protease inhibitors which mean they attack a hepatitis c virus hcv enzyme that is essential for the virus to make new copies of itself each of the drugs brings virus replication to a near halt but when used alone hcv quickly becomes resistant to each of the new drugs that is why they have to be given in combination meanwhile people with hepatitis c wonder when they will see the really big breakthrough everyone is waiting for 鈥 a drug combination that works for nearly everyone and which does not require either interferon or ribavirin such treatments are in the pipeline some experts say they may come in as few as two or three years while others say it will be a decade before they are finally here what is for sure is that telaprevir and victrelis are just the first in what is hoped will be a long line of treatment options for people with the deadly hepatitis c virus

told to use tea tree oil to clean out ear wax was not told to dilute it now it feels clogged did i damage my hearing,you may have had a partial wax impaction but when you added the oil the wax softened and now you have a complete wax impaction it is very unlikely that you damaged your hearing so assuming that you do not have ear pain or other signs of an ear infection you can lavage wash out your ear canal with a gentle stream of warm water just slightly warmer than your body temperature the warm water stream will most likely dislodge the softened wax so you can do this in the shower allow a stream of shower water to go in your ear canal a hand held shower works the best once the water gets out of your ear your hearing should return to its normal level again
how much sleep does my child need,the amount of sleep that a child needs is going to be based on that child is age actually we have a great article on webmd where you can actually click on the different ages to find out what your child is sleep need is going to be but generally speaking what we are finding in national sleep foundation is polls is that kids are not getting enough sleep and they are also not getting sleep at the times that they need it may be an enjoyable thing to because you are coming home late to be able to spend some time with your child and have them stay up past their bedtime but it really can be a detriment to their health in the long run in the first year of life children are going to sleeping north of 18 hours in some cases maybe as little as 12 or 13 hours but that oftentimes occurs if you have a very colicky baby or a reflux baby try to know and understand what health issues could be going on there when you get into the 2 to 3 range that is when your children should be sleeping about 11 鈥 12 hours then when you start to move into grade school you are going to be looking at 9 to 10 hours and you should your kids should stick to the 9 to 10 hour range almost through high school very few high schoolers get that much sleep and so interestingly what we have found is first of all high school age children tend to swing and want to stay up late and sleep late and so anybody out there who has a high school age kid knows that the kids want to stay up til 200 am and then they want to sleep til noon uh that is a natural occurrence for them believe it or not in minnesota they actually changed school start times and they found that kids increased their grades by almost a full letter grade by actually going to school later and staying later so when you are talking with your children about sleep one of the things that you want to say is hey this is very important for you first of all it helps you learn second of all it helps your overall mood and finally it really helps your health and so i try to make the importance of sleep greater for children so that way they can get an understanding of it it is not that mom or dad wants you to go to bed at a certain time because they are mean it is because they are actually doing something better for your health

are these symptoms indicative of dehydration  dark foul smelling urine extreme thirst itchy skin hemoglobin of 6 8 confusion hard stools,most helpful answer the answer is yes and no some of your symptoms could be indicative of dehydation namely dark colored urine extreme thirst itchy skin hard stools confusion but dehydration is not the only condition that could cause these symptoms i hope you are following up with a medical professional about these symptoms to determine the underlying cause regarding your hemoglobin results i wonder if you are referring to the actual hemoglobin test or if you are referring to the  hemoglobin a1c  test these are two entirely different things basically a hemoglobin test measures your red blood cell count a result of 6 8 would be quite low for either a woman or a man in fact that result would put you in the  anemic  category and it would require medical treatment on the other hand a hemoglobin a1c test provides a snapshot of your blood sugar control over the preceding three months a result of 6 8 would be considered within the desirable range for someone with diabetes it would be considered outside the normal range for someone without diagnosed diabetes i would suggest you make an appointment with your primary care provider pcp to review your symptoms get a diagnosis and come up with a treatment plan best to you

i am pregnant with hives what can i take,this is a tough one because antihistamine use which is typically a product used to treat hives really can not be used in pregnant women i would ask her how often is she getting the hives and is this related to something along the food allergy so she could avoid certain foods a lot of people do not realize too when they change detergents they actually can get an allergic reaction and that might cause hives sometimes pregnant women will figure well i have to go with a different detergent now that i am pregnant now a lot of times it is that reaction that will cause this ask if she has been to a doctor dermatologist to see if they are aware of the fact that she is breaking out like this one of the great products that we have available is an oatmeal bath or aveeno products that is great to kind of calm down them but if it seems like it is getting more and more common and more severe she needs to go see her doctor to have it checked out even further according to motherisk which is the authority for drug safety in pregnancy in canada first generation antihistamines such as benadryl are safe during pregnancy <link>

i am having severe stabbing pain at the base of my neck on the left side also with pain in my shoulder due to the severity of the pain scale of 1 10 i would call it an 8 or 9 i am seriously thinking of going to the er this started last night so i slept on my back took an ibuprofen 800 and took a super hot shower with my wifes super massage head to no avail the pain has only gotten worse please help,so sorry to hear you are going through this it is difficult to cope with severe pain unless you are experiencing crushing pain in your chest and shortness of breath along with this pain in your neck please do not clog up the emergency room the emergency department should be reserved for true life or death emergencies or serious traumas like broken bones unfortunately severe neck pain does not rise to that level what you are describing sounds like the classic symptom of a pinched nerve there are many possible causes for neck pain ranging from a herniated spinal disc to a muscle spasm it sounds like you have done everything right in terms of home treatment however one round of ibuprofen one hot shower and one good massage may not be enough to alleviate the pain especially if it is caused by something like a herniated disk also note no one should take more than 2400 milligrams of ibuprofen within a 24 hour period and no more than 800mg every 8 hours  again assuming you are not exhibiting any symptoms of a heart attack which generally do not include stabbing pain at the base of the neck your best bet is to continue to try home remedies if the situation does not clear up within a few days make an appointment with your primary health care provider for an evaluation if the situation gets worse such as your arm starts to go numb then you might consider heading for an urgent care facility wishing you well

what are the treatments for obsessive compulsive disorder ocd,most individuals with ocd experience some symptoms of the disorder indefinitely with times of improvement alternating with times of difficulty treatments include cognitive behavioral psychotherapy behavioral therapies and medications behavioral therapies for ocd include ritual prevention and exposure therapy prevention of rituals involves a mental health professional helping the ocd sufferer to endure longer and longer periods of resisting the urge to engage in compulsive behaviors exposure therapy is the process by which the individual with ocd is put in touch with situations that tend to increase the ocd sufferer is urge to engage in compulsions then helping him or her resist that urge cognitivebehavioral therapists help patients change the negative styles of thinking and behaving that are often associated with the anxiety involved with obsessive compulsive disorder selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ssris are the medications that are most commonly used to treat ocd these medications increase the amount of the neurochemical serotonin in the brain remember that brain serotonin levels are thought to be low in ocd  as their name implies the ssris work by selectively inhibiting blocking serotonin reuptake in the brain ssris have fewer side effects than clomipramine an older medication that is actually thought to be somewhat more effective in treating ocd ssris do not cause orthostatic hypotension a sudden drop in blood pressure when sitting up or standing and heart rhythm disturbances like clomipramine can therefore ssris are often the first line treatment for this illness examples of ssris include fluoxetine prozac paroxetine paxil sertraline zoloft citalopram celexa fluvoxamine luvox and escitalopram lexapro when the improvement that people with ocd experience is not optimal when an ssri is the only medication prescribed the addition of a neuroleptic medication like risperidone risperdal olanzapine zyprexa or aripiprazole abilify can sometimes be helpful ssris are generally well tolerated and side effects are usually mild the most common side effects are nausea diarrhea agitation insomnia and headache however these side effects generally go away within the first month of ssri use some patients experience sexual side effects such as decreased sexual desire decreased libido delayed orgasm or an inability to have an orgasm some patients experience tremors with ssris newer often called atypical neuroleptic medications tend to cause fewer side effects than many of the older medications in this class the most common side effects of atypical neuroleptics include sleepiness dizziness dry mouth and weight gain sometimes people can be more sensitive to the effects of the sun while taking these medications and therefore should take care to wear adequate sunblock whenever exposed to the sun less commonly side effects of atypical neuroleptic medications can result in painless although abnormal muscle movements like tremors stiffness and very rarely permanent muscle twitches called tardive dyskinesia studies on the effectiveness of treatment of ocd in adults have variable results some indicate that medications response prevention and cbt are equally although only mildly to moderately effective in treating this problem cognitive behavioral group therapy cbgt has also been found to be

do diet pills interact with depression and bipolar meds such as wellbutrin and geodon,this is a great question because actually the two drugs mentioned wellbutrin and geodon actually can cause some weight gain so i would actually ask this patient number one are they telling their doctors that they    they may be seeing two different doctors are they aware that they are taking these medications and do they have a medication list because of the side effect profile we are adding a medication that we really probably do not need i would like to be able to find a more non drug option such as changing their diet increasing their fluid intake so we want to make sure that that patient understands that the pharmacist by looking at their medication list when they are coming to visit the pharmacy will be able to point that out and say hey you are getting an unnecessary medication for side effect of two drugs and maybe one of them they may not necessarily need so that is where the pharmacist can actually contact the physicians or healthcare provider and say doctor are you aware of this this happens all the time in the pharmacy i can not tell you how many times i say to patients does your doctor know well i went to this doctor for this medicine but this doctor does not know about this one everyone needs to know about it that is why that medication list is so important not only is it help the pharmacist but bring it to all your other doctor appointments that way they can see everything that everyone is prescribing and we can avoid medication errors and unnecessary use i also have been on sooo many anti depressants and other meds for bipolar ii and always gained weight i am a 40 year old woman who is 51 tall and at that time almost 150 pounds but i was just prescribed a very new anti depressant called fetzima there is not any generic version as of yet i am on the max dose at 80mg daily but add lamictal adderall xanax seroquel ambien xr propranolol imitrex injections cambia liquid spinx nasal spray and lastly phenergen 25mg prn migraine with vomiting but my point which i apologize for going off in so many directions thanks to the adderall 60mg daily the fetzima is supposedly much better as far as weight is concerned it actually lists that weight loss is more common than weight gain and while i would never suggest anyone to be on a stimulantadderall when i have never been addadhd i take it daily and in a pretty decent dosage to somehow get me to function thru the day it is hard to figure out as the patient why a doctor would put you on a lot of uppers and then you need downers it is crazy but with the adderall i have been on for almost 3 months and in all honestly i now weigh 103 pounds so over 45 plus pounds
what is less damaging smoking 3 cigarettes per day or picking two days of the week and smoking 10 on each of those days  i know that light smoking still poses significant risks i know i can still get cancer one day from doing it so please do not answer by telling me that i am looking to significantly cut down in order to lessen the damage i am doing to myself while still indulging a little in one of my favorite activities so here are my two options a smoke about 3 cigsday about 20week or b pick 2 nightsweek say two nights when i am out socializing and smoke about 10 on each of those about 20week,i wish i could give you a good answer but i do not think researchers have studied smoking at quite that micro a level in healthcare we measure smoking by the packyear  we calculate this number based on the average number of packs smoked per day times the number of years the person has smoked for example a person who smokes one pack per day for 20 years has a 20 packyear history a person like yourself who smokes on average 20 cigarettes per week which calculates to roughly 0 15 pack per day for 20 years would have a roughly 3 packyear history    the same as a person who smoked one pack per day for three years regardless of the manner in which you smoke a lot at one time or a few spread out over a longer period you are probably doing about the same amount of damage to your lungs and other vital structures intuitively i would think the damage would be worse from smoking many cigarettes all at once as opposed to smoking the same number spread out over a greater length of time rapidly introducing a volume of carcinogens and toxins probably is worse than trickling them in you sound well informed about the risks of smoking so i will leave you with one little tidbit did you know one of the more common cancers related to smoking is bladder cancer especially in men so the next time you light up ask yourself if you can envision the day when you will be emptying your urine through a pouch strapped to your thigh if not then you might want to re think the whole smoking thing wishing you well i wish i could give you a good answer but i do not think researchers have studied smoking at quite that micro a level in healthcare we measure smoking by the packyear  we calculate this number based on the average number of packs smoked per day times the number of years the person has smoked for example a person who smokes one pack per day for 20 years has a 20 packyear history a person like yourself who smokes on average 20 cigarettes per week which calculates to roughly 0 15 pack per day for 20 years would have a roughly 3 packyear history    the same as a person who smoked one pack per day for three years regardless of the manner in which you smoke a lot at one time or a few spread out over a longer period you are probably doing about the same amount of damage to your lungs and other vital structures intuitively i would think the damage would be worse from smoking many cigarettes all at once as opposed to smoking the same number spread out over a greater length of time rapidly introducing a volume of carcinogens and toxins probably is worse than trickling them in you sound well informed about

should low testosterone be treated even if there are no symptoms  what is the risk of a borderline low level what if is not treated,that is a very interesting question i am glad you asked in the medical community we often tend not to treat a condition that is asymptomatic does not have symptoms as long as you are sure your low testosterone levels are not related to another condition such as obesity or diabetes i think the choice of whether or not to treat it is up to you it is a discussion you should have with your health care provider he or she can contribute their expert medical knowledge and you can take into account your personal values and feelings between the two of you you can arrive at a decision that is right for you remember too you can always change your mind if you choose not to treat your low testosterone now but experience symptoms in the future you can always opt for testosterone replacement therapy likewise if you decide to treat your low testosterone now you can always choose to discontinue treatment later take care

i had water in my ear i put a q tip in to absorb it not far in but it had a tiny bit of red blood on it when removed  my right ear has always given me a problem because i use a syringe to clean out my ear when i was a teenager and it hurt all day long now it always is very sensitive and hurts when you put anything in it do i need to see a doctor about this ear,a tiny amount of blood would not be a cause for alarm the skin lining of the ear canal is rich in blood supply so you most likely irritated it when you used the q tip it is best to never use q tips inside the ear canal one of reasons water had a difficult time coming out of ears is because you do not have a adequate protective coating of ear wax when water meets a waxy surface it will just bead up and fall out by gravity but if you do not have a waxy surface the water will remain

how fast can arthritis develope in a broken foot i broke my left foot over a year ago and am still having problems i have been told it is arthritis and nothing can be done except fuse the foot what no one can or will tell me is why no problem before breaking the foot but after breaking it i suddenly have arthritis can it develop that fast i feel like the doctors and insurance nurse just want me to go away thank you,hm you raise an interesting question it is true that broken bones may be more prone to developing arthritis it helps to understand that osteoarthritis which is what we are talking about here does not necessarily mean the development of painful bony spurs in a joint which is what a lot of people think technically osteoarthritis refers to the raw edges of two pieces of bone rubbing together painfully we usually think of osteoarthritis as something that comes on gradually over the course of years because that is how the disease usually progresses in healthy tissue osteoarthritis is called the wear and tear disease because under normal circumstances the cartilage between bones in a joint wears away over the decades until the two pieces of bone grind against each other however the course may be different for osteoarthritis caused by trauma such as a broken bone i would suggest you sit down with your doctor and have him or her define arthritis for you so that you understand better what they are talking about they should also be able to explain in very clear terms how it is arthritis could develop in your foot so quickly i hope this information helps i happened to be in the same boat as you except i now know for sure i have to have fusion in my wrist which will dramatically reduce my wrist is range of motion i fractured my wrist twice first time very badly in 1981 and the second time only about 2 years ago although it was set correctly yet the second time it broke very easily because it had become suseptive to breakage due to the first severe fracture it only took one year for my wrist to develope arthritis to the extend that the only solution now is fusion withtitanium i have very soft bones and my body is arthitis proned and any trauma to my bones especially to areas that bones connect to catlidge soon develope arthritis in your case i think for one your fracture must have been relatively severe and in an area where jointcartlidge has an imprtant and pehaps muli range function and two it could have not been set very correctly and or your joints like mine are proned to arthritis due trauma physical therapy is very important after the bone heals age certainly has someting to do with it in other words the younger one is the better and quicker the bone and cartlidge heal and thus the likelihood of development of arthritis is less what triggers arthritis is when cartlidges between two connecting bones ware off due to either age or trauma usually when the connecting bone to the cartlidge is repositioned off its normal or natural position which can occur with bone fracture or even after it set do get second and third openion from expert surgeons good luck had this happen to me did the fussion 3 times and they all failed i am type 2 diabetic so

my brother in law accidentlty poked his hand with a jack knife it bled and now he has a lump where he got poked,sorry to hear about this it is hard to tell what is going on here without doing a physical examination depending on the size of the wound that lump could be a normal part of the healing process or it could be an infection or hematoma collection of blood in the tissue if your brother in law develops a fever over 101f as measured by a thermometer not just by feeling a forehead or guessing he should get checked out by a medical professional as this may be a sign of an infection developing also if the wound continues to swell turns hot to the touch or oozes a green foul smelling discharge those would all be reasons to head for urgent care i am wondering if your brother in law is up to date on his tetanus shot every adult needs a booster injection every 10 years if your brother in law does not know if his tetanus immunization is current he should be alert for symptoms of tetanus that could develop within 2 weeks of this accident including headache trouble opening his mouth lockjaw trouble swallowing stiff neck back and shoulders again i am sorry to hear about this accident it is a good reminder to be careful using sharp objects and also for everyone to keep their tetanus shot current

most of my bowel movements are hard pebbles most of the time i use a rubber glove on my hand to get the stool out why i eat a lot of fiber and have used senocot and miralax without much relief i also have pain in my groin area that affects my walking sometimes i have been having this problem for a few years i also have gerd and take protonics for that what can i do,i certainly think you should see a doctor about this what you are describing sounds like very hard stool that is difficult to pass this possibly could cause a bowel obstruction eventually it sounds like you have done some good things by eating plenty of fiber and trying laxatives you should also be sure to drink plenty of fluids to stay well hydrated some medications for acid reflux can cause constipation so be aware of that your health care provider should be able to help you figure out if you have a serious constipation issue or if there is something else going on either way a medical professional can help you treat this and get back to having comfortable bowel movements best wishes to you
can vagisil treat vaginal warts and yeasts,the short answer is no  but there is more to it than that vagisil is an over the counter product designed to treat some of the symptoms of a yeast infection including itching however vagisil does not contain medication to treat the yeast infection itself for that you first need an accurate diagnosis from a doctor second you need a medication such as miconazole cream vaginal warts are a whole other story genital warts are a sexually transmitted disease if you believe you have vaginal warts you need to avoid having sex even with a condom and see a doctor as soon as possible to determine if you have been infected with human papillomavirus hpv i hope you can see a health care provider soon to get a diagnosis and treatment if necessary best wishes to you
my doctor has given me a really expensive medication pristiq are there any ways to reduce those costs,i know it is hard to justify when you get a new medication and it is expensive but this medication might be the right medication and in the long run might actually save you money this is a once a day medication it is used for depression and if it helps you and it makes you feel better then that is a good price to pay when you do not feel well with depression and you do not take these types of medications and you take some that have to be taken more frequently or might have more side effects you forget to take them therefore if there is a price on your quality of life and then also you are going to see the doctor more often which means that your overall healthcare costs are actually going up so there are patient assistance programs available through the manufacturers patients may want to look into that as helping offset the cost of that medication at the end of the day it might be the right fit

it is too expensive is there a cheaper alternative,sometimes if you use a soy based product that can help make the hair appear finer softer and some have even said that it slows the hair growth so you can look for products that are soy based and that might help you to start with vaniqa is a prescription product that is often not covered by insurance and can be expensive you can try different pharmacies and you might find some cost savings there but what vaniqa does is that it contains an ingredient that blocks an enzyme that the hair follicle requires to grow and in that way it slows the growth of hair it does not work for everybody and it can take about two months to really see the results and then when you stop using it it stops working so this is a product that if it works for you can be quite dramatic but you will have to use it over time to maintain the results

if you dip half of a lemon in sugar and put it on your face is that bad for your skin  my sister and i are having a debate on wether or not sugar and lemon are good for your skin if you dip half a lemon in sugar and use it as a scrub on your face will that cause any bad reactions i know that you are not suppose to go out in direct sunlight after doing this but what else can it cause i am using this scrub and nothing happens but she says its not safe,if putting lemon and sugar on your face was therapeutic and effective for skin problems everyone would be doing it lemons have high acid content and bacteria one of the underlying causes of acne is not found of acid but i have never read a study that supports this method acne is caused by hormones and you really can not scrub hormones away washing your face is fine for the oil but acne is not caused by dirty skin i am assuming that acne is your issue rather than put fruit all over your face as well as sticky sugar my suggestion would be for you to see your medical provider or a dermatologist for some expert advice there are so many excellent acne medications available to you and they are proven to be more effective than any home remedy

why is it that obesity does not always cause type 2 diabetes,it is true that the more severe the degree of obesity the greater the odds of type 2 diabetes that is because the excess body fat fuels insulin resistance in the muscles and organs there may be adverse hormonal effects on the beta cells as well after years of insulin resistance the beta cells wear down to the point where prediabetes or full type 2 diabetes occurs but only in a certain fraction of indiviiduals with obesity we do not fully understand why some people with obesity are at risk for diabetes while others can be obese their whole lives without getting it the answer is likely in the genetics but we do not know which genes confer protection or susceptibility similarly some thin people develop type 2 diabetes despite minimal insulin resistance again the answer is in the genes but we do not know which genes

i have been doing the juicing diet from fat sick and nearly dead i have done it for a week and have not lost anything i have done almost every diet in the book i recently stopped taking all of my medications because i was tired of them i started doing the juicing diet juicing vegetables and fruits i have been doing it for a week and have not lost a single pound but i am now feeling good but no weight loss i got frustrated this weekend and ate mcdonalds which is why i am fat in the first place i did not gain but i did not lose could there be a condition that is not letting me lose,i understand how frustrating it can be to try different diets only to not lose weight or gain it all back it is important to remember you are not alone and most people have difficulty losing weight and keeping it off in fact a major review found that two thirds of people who diet not only gain their weight back but gain even more weight than when they started the diet i am not sure what your health is like or how much you need to lose but you might want to consider a different approach one that does not focus so much on weight here is why the problem with diets is that they do not get at the root cause of someone is eating you might want to consider working with a registered dietitian who focuses on eating issues and a more intuitivemindful eating approach the key is to develop a healthy lifestyle you enjoy that helps you lose gradual weight instead of an unrealistic diet that is hard to maintain you can find a dietitian near you by going to eatright org if you are worried about a medical condition by all means get a physical and check your thyroid and discuss your health status with a healthcare provider good luck

what ingredients should be avoided for someone who has a gluten sensitivity  i have been tested for celiac and that is not the issue it is just a gluten sensitivity but i am unsure what all i should avoid besides wheat barley rye and being cautious of soy products,gluten is a protein found in wheat rye barley and crossbred hybrids of these grains the good news is many foods are naturally free of gluten including fruits vegetables lean proteins nuts oils and dairy the nutrition label can help you determine which products gluten free the term gluten free can be helpful but is not a regulated claim even though the fda is working to define it when you read a label look for gluten containing ingredients including wheat barley rye oats due to likely cross contamination brewers yeast and malt beer labeling laws require allergens to be labeled including wheat proteins so any food that says contains wheat is off limits this does not apply to barley rye and oats or items that may have been cross contaminated so if there is any doubt contact the manufacturer you might want to discuss with your healthcare provider if you can tolerate small amounts of gluten if you can you may not need to be as vigilant as those with celiac for more on going gluten free check out this slideshow

what are the symptoms of whooping cough,it starts like a cold with congestion and upper respiratory symptoms after a week or so a cough develops the cough worsens over several days and the coughing fits may be so severe that you can not stop or catch your breath a coughing fit may be followed by a 鈥渨hoop鈥 as the person gasps to catch their breath it is these coughing fits called paroxysms which cause doctors to be worried about pertussis and try to confirm the diagnosis in people who have been vaccinated or who have had pertussis before the symptoms may be nonspecific pertussis is high on the list if that whoop is present but if it is absent pertussis may go unrecognized it is important to know that infants with pertussis do not always cough in young babies the first sign of pertussis may be difficulty breathing or pauses in breathing that last more than 20 seconds called 鈥渁pnea 鈥 apnea is serious and requires immediate medical attention for our infant 4mo daughter it started like a pretty normal cough 5 days later the cough had only gotten worse it went from one or two of the infant double cough pairs up to runs of 6 or 8 double cough pairs lasting more like ten seconds we took her to a walk in clinic for a persussis swab that day but she stopped breathing that night and turned blue we called the ambulance and it was a close call but still it is quite crazy how quickly it escalated if you do not hear the telltale whoop it can still be pertussis the whoop did not show up for us until after we had the apnea episodes and were already checked into the hospital the 50 or whatever for a walk in clinic could save your childs life if you end up in the hospital for a week like we did it will cost a lot more than that anyway if an infant is 6mo or older i would not be quick to run fearfully to the clinic but for young ones it is well worth the cautionary checkup if your child has had a cough for more than a few days

is there a link between sleep and long term memory,a new study has found a direct link between sleep and the creation of long term memories scientists at washington university school of medicine have discovered a cluster of cells in the fruit fly brain that controls sleep by manipulating those cells scientists were able to establish long term memories in fruit flies by controlling their sleep habits using their ability to control the fruit flies sleep the scientists tested the insects ability to learn 鈥 and retain 鈥 information here is how they did it and what they found as a test of learning researchers exposed male fruit flies to other male flies that had been engineered to smell like female fruit flies after a few unsuccessful mating attempts the flies learned not to court these female in disguise flies without sleep the fruit flies retained this knowledge of the pretend female flies for a short period of time amounting to a few hours scientists put their fruit fly subjects to sleep after the courtship training with sleep the fruit flies were able to retain the same information for several days sleep enabled the fruit flies to convert short term knowledge into long term memory we have long known that there was a relationship between sleep memory and learning you do not have to be a scientist to have a sense of this think about your typical state of mind 鈥 and your inclination to retain new information 鈥 at the end of a long busy day our brains use sleep as the time to determine what information can be discarded and what is useful enough that it should be stored as longer term memories

was at gym on ab crunch machine pushed too heavy weight and felt a pop in my stomach felt like something stuck out well i was at the gym this morning on the ab crunch machine i leaned forward to push my normal weight and it did not move so i pushed extra hard and i think it was too hard immediately after i leaned the weight forward it was followed by a bubble like feeling in my abdomen that moved upward towards my chest and i lost my breath it felt like something popped out for a couple of seconds this evening i am just really sore and occasionally am getting sharp pains in my stomach,oh ouch so much for that whole working out is healthy thing right ha ha well i think you need to get this checked out i would suggest making an appointment with your primary care provider you may merely have strained a muscle but then again you could have torn one and that would require medical attention luckily the abdomen is protected with layer upon layer of muscle so it is not too likely you suffered say a bowel herniation or something nonetheless if you start running a fever or vomiting or develop any other unusual symptoms you might consider heading for an urgent care otherwise you are probably fine to just check in with your primary care provider and of course do not do any weightlifting of any kind until you are cleared by your doc to do so even leg work can strain your abs and you really need to rest them for now best wishes

how do you break a fever in a toddler,remember that any fever in a newborn infant under 3 months of age needs prompt medical attention because at that age it is hard to tell when a serious infection might be present a fever is the body is natural response to infection or other illness and will subside when the underlying process gets better other than treating the infection or other condition causing it no home treatments can shorten the duration of a fever also remember that fever does not always need to be treated if a toddler is acting normally and unbothered by her fever and her temperature is less than 104 degrees 40 degrees celsius there is no need to treat the fever for a fever that is high or is bothering your toddler either acetaminophen mapap tylenol or ibuprofen advil motrin are good treatments you will need to know your toddler is weight do not guess and use the dosing guidelines on the package it is best to stick with one medicine if you can if you feel you need to use multiple drugs call your pediatrician is office do not ever use aspirin to treat a child is fever as it increases the risk for reye is syndrome if sponging with water helps your child with a fever feel better use a warm bath not cool with water around 85 degrees i know it sounds weird but my great granny used to cut an onion in half and put one half on the bottom of each foot then cover with socks and leave them on me all night in addition to tylenol or advil when i would wake up in the morning my fever would be gone or at least drasticly reduced and the onions in my socks would be black she said the onions drew the fever away from the brain and other vital organs i do not unserstand how it works but i used this on my children and now on my grands and it works every time it helps to understand what a fever is some of the answers on here are very misleading and are not factual at all a fever occurs when the body increases in temperature most common cause of this is an infection of some kind the white blood cells that eat the infection release chemicals that go to the brain and tell it to raise the temperature of the body the brain has a set point for our temperature 98 6f it is like a central heatingcooling system with a thermostat in a house if the temp gets hot the ac turns on if it gets to cold the heater kicks on and the temperature stays at 98 6f what these chemicals from the white blood cells do is they increase the thermostat so the brain now has a set point of 101 f but the body is still 98 6 f so the heater kicks on you get shivers moving of muscles fast makes heat you

what would be the reasoning for my cycle to skip 1 month & then next be only 3 4 days then the next last for 2 weeks,many things can cause irregular periods even in women who are usually regular you do not say what your age is but perimenopause is heralded by getting irregular periods with perimenopause the irregularity is caused by the production of less estrogen by your ovaries in women too young for menopause irregular periods can be caused by all of these things and more excessive weight loss eating disorders emotional stress medications problems with pelvic organs if you have always had regular periods that now are becoming irregular why not make an appointment with your gynecologist he or she is in the best position to assess why your cycle may have become irregular and remember you can still become pregnant even if your periods are irregular so continue to practice birth control if pregnancy is not your goal best wishes to you

what illnesses often co exist with bipolar disorder,my son now 16 has been medicated ultimately for bi polar disorder since he was three initially diagnosed as adhd ocd odd and anxiety nos i knew there was a problem from birth because he never slept through the night with symptoms straight out of a textbook and after exhaustive testing i was finally able to locate a physician who was not afraid to medicate my son no one wants to medicate a child and rightly so however after the aforementioned textbook symptoms became evidenced on a daily basis there was no denying either the diagnosis or the medication regimen necessary to treat him to a lesser degree my son also suffers from social phobia and obesity the former supported in peer interaction and the latter due to medication last of all he suffers from body aches all over muscular skeletal pain he has always complained of neck and back pain originally attributed to growth spurts which he describes as  wouldeep and into the bone rather than something akin to pulled muscles stretching massage and chiropractic appear to help to some degree however real sustained relief has never been achieved unfortunately my son is psychiatrist has not been able to find literature supporting my contention that his body pain is also related to his bpd these aches have been a consistent complaint since my son was first active and able to really articulate his feelings he is an active teen basketball bike riding etc  and when he comes in for the day he is almost never without complaint i do believe his body pain is related to either his diagnosis or his medication he is on six but i am unable to prove this theory i also know as my son ages and grows he may evidence other signs and symptoms of this disease thus far we have been fortunate that he has not suffered any suicidal ideation substance abuse or metabolic syndrome however as he becomes an adult and is tasked with making his own decisions i can only hope he we is are able to maintain the status quo

what is the normal gallbladder ejection fraction range  i have been told mine is low following a hida scan but i have no gallstones,most helpful answer the normal gallbladder ejection fraction ranges from 35 to 75 if you are having pain that suggests gallstones but no stones are present this is called acalculous biliary pain abp acalculous simply means no stones  and biliary means related to bile bile ducts and systems gallbladder ejection fraction testing is one measure used to diagnose abp if you suffer from abp you have at least a couple of options because biliary pain usually is intermittent and often seems to come on after eating fatty foods you can try avoiding fatty foods to see if this helps the pain go away another option is removal of the gallbladder  cholecystectomy  but this is somewhat controversial some tests show people with abp benefit from cholecystectomy but the trouble is there are not really enough tests to reach a definitive conclusion about that talk things over with your health care provider to see what he or she recommends and go from there i hope you feel better

what is the max dosage of zyrtec  i am a 62 280 lb male can i take 20 mg total of zyrtec at once i read somewhere the max dosage is 20mg,cetirizine zyrtec is an antihistamine that is used for allergies it is available over the counter the maximum recommended dose of zyrtec is 10mg per day studies have been done in people with chronic hives comparing the 10 mg to the 20 mg dose of zyrtec and no advantage was seen with the higher dose the recommended dose of zyrtec is not based on weight and height whenever you take a higher than recommended dose of a medication you increase your risk of side effects although zyrtec is available over the counter that does not mean it is harmless zyrtec can cause sleepiness and this effect is increased when zyrtec is combined with alcohol or other drugs that cause sedation zyrtec use has also been associated with liver damage in rare individuals play it safe and stick with the recommended dose talk with your doctor about using zyrtec and whether the benefits of increasing the dose outweigh the risks i am a conservative medical provider so i rarely if ever push the recommended dosages on zyrtec or any drug these things are carefully studied during the clinical trials so taking two may not be considered toxic or dangerous for a short period of time even for a big guy but this dose is not recommended like many drugs this one is excreted by your kidneys so why push the limit <link> if this or any drug is not controlling allergy symptoms it may be better to try something else there are many ways to treat allergies than exceeding recommended dosages talk to your medical provider but i bet he or she will not endorse your double dosage

what should i do if i have trouble waking up in the morning,humans go through four to six sleep cycles every night each cycle consists of five stages ranging from very light sleep stage 1 to very deep sleep stage 4 and then the rapid eye movement stage during which you are most likely to dream waking up out of a deep stage 3 or stage 4 sleep is notoriously difficult that is why being awakened from a nap can be so disorienting it is also why waking too early in the morning can mean a miserable start to your day most people hit their deepest sleep between 4 a m and 6 a m so it is very hard to wake up during that time so wake up later if you can otherwise make sure you go to bed early enough to get a good night is rest some other tips for waking up set your alarm for the latest possible moment so you are not tempted to fall back asleep lose the snooze button you might go back to sleep for a few minutes each time you hit the knob but you are getting crappy sleep you just feel worse sit up and swing your legs over the side of the bed breathe deeply three or four times to orient yourself to the real world exercise first thing in the morning to energize your mind and body and boost your fitness but do not choose exercise over getting the sleep you need
im on cumdine = so i cant eat any dark leafy veggies  what other foods cant i eat  i need a guide= to what i can eat and cant eat  on cumidine   can i eat peanuts  can i eat potatoes  if i eat veggies how much each day or do i alternate= with a salad  i eat a handful since i do not know if a cup a day  is just vegetable or includes green salad  a cupful,the good news is that most people do not have to drastically change their diet when they start on the blood thinner warfarin coumadin but you do have to pay close attention to what you are eating the goal is to keep the level of vitamin k about the same from day to day you can do this by knowing which foods have a lot of vitamin k and not making any big changes in how much of them you are eating each day foods that have a lot of vitamin k include most of the green leafy vegetables like spinach kale lettuce cabbage swiss chard endive and seaweed greens such as turnip collard and mustard are all high in vitamin k as well other vegetables that contain a lot of vitamin k are cauliflower broccoli and asparagus liver is also high in vitamin k other things to watch out for include green tea canola oil and soybean oil peanuts and potatoes do not have a large amount of vitamin k but watch out for cashews and pine nuts they have a bit more vitamin k so eat them sparingly so what does all this mean if you have always had a salad for lunch then it is probably fine to keep eating one every day as long as it is ok with your doctor if you want broccoli or asparagus with your dinner for a change then it would be best to skip the salad that day and remember to keep your portions small liver has a lot of cholesterol so i would recommend skipping that altogether if your doctor has recommended a multivitamin make sure you take it every day they usually have vitamin k in them as well so you want to be consistent talk to your doctor before making any changes in your diet do not take any over the counter medicines or supplements without checking with your doctor first some of them may interfere with your medicine also be sure to get all blood tests done on time do not be overwhelmed it may seem like a lot to do at first but it will become second nature before you know it

is there any safe way to increase my height in few inches 2 3 before the growth plates closed  i am 20 years old male and my height is 52 my father is also that height but my younger brother18y is 5 7 if it is a genetic problem how my brother is taller then me  i am doing so many exercises and i take calcium pills every other night but can not see any growing up since i started to exercise since few months i really need to grow taller without taking bad pills and painful surgeries please tell me how to grow up taller before it naturally stops,the growth plates closes in most humans somewhere in the range of 13 years to 22 years of age since you are 20 years old and your father is also 52 your maximum height has probably already been reached the honest truth is that 5 2 is an acceptable height the laws of genetics sometimes provide for traits that can vary greatly from sibling to sibling in my own family there were six 6 boys three of them had brown colored eyes while the other three 3 had green eyes blood types were also evenly divided between o and a two 2 of the brothers were five 5 inches taller than the other four 4 brothers you can see a endocrinologist about any recent developments in the field of growth this specialist in diagnosing and treating hormonal issues may assess your height and make recommendations based on current medical science hgh is a drug that is available used to treat children who are short of stature my last remembrance is that the fda has not granted approval for hgh to be prescribed for adults unless they have some other acceptable medical condition besides the short stature condition this medication also comes with many potential side effects and can cost between 10 000 00 and 30 000 00 for treatment it may not seem fair right now to be 52 at 20 years old but most other people do not really care about that one 1 physical trait as times goes by and your comfort level as an adult increases you will also feel very comfortable with being 52 tall

i get eczema on my legs every summer my skin looks awful what stuff can i get from the drugstore to help my skin,it is really important to moisturize effectively sometimes just a little bit of dry skin can make your skin itchy and once you start that itch scratch cycle it can be relentless and very painful i have seen people scratch till they bleed sometimes then when that heals it heals with discoloration and that can last a very long time especially when it is below the knee which is the slowest part of the body to heal so the first and most important thing you do is to hydrate the skin this is done first in the bath or shower so a 10 15 minute bath or shower you can use an oatmeal powder in the bath if you like or a gentle cleanser then as soon as you step out just pat your skin dry so it is still damp and then use a very hydrating moisturizer by this i mean a cream or an ointment not a lotion not an oil because those are too water based too light and will actually help you lose more water from the skin so you need something more rich and emollient on top of that you can put on a white cotton sock or even a plastic lining obviously not too tight you do not want to suffocate your leg but something that is going to help lock that moisture and water into the skin so you can put a plastic wrap on top and then put a sock over it to help really lock that moisture in and that also keeps your hands away from scratching at it
can i be pregnant my last period was on 10<negative_smiley>12 my boyfriend ejaculated in me on 101712 now my period did not come my period was suppose to come on 1122012 but i am late i have always been regular never been late in my life,any time you are not using birth control it is possible to get pregnant it is pretty much that simple ok maybe not granted there are some days when you are much more fertile than others because you are ovulating or on the verge of ovulating assuming your period started on 108 the date of 1017 would be right around your  fertile window  so yes you could possibly be pregnant keep in mind fertility calculators like the one i linked to above are not foolproof the ovaries do not consult a calendar before popping out an egg so you could possibly ovulate before a calendar says you are fertile    or after if your period was due 112 you certainly could take an over the counter pregnancy test now to see if you are pregnant or not i wish you the result you desire

the dermatologist says if i go out in the sun after having ipl treatments my age spots will come back what can i do,one thing about treating the skin is that it is an ongoing process so it is environmental damage and sun exposure that cause these brown spots to begin with and so once we treat them if you go back and get that damage again chances are you will have new spots created some spots that are going to come up over time just from previous exposures will still come through even if you never get sun exposure again so having the ipl treatment did benefit you because now your skin looks more clear and it is more healthy and younger skin but you have to protect and preserve that skin in order to maintain the results it does not mean you need to sit at home in a darkroom in order to maintain that result but you have to be sun smart try to wear a hat when you can use an spf of 15 or higher even if it is a cloudy day do not be fooled by a day that does not feel so hot or sunny reapply that sunscreen on a regular basis and stay in the shade when you can and that will do the best for you in order to minimize those spots from returning also using over the counter products that contain ingredients like niacinamide and retinoids can help the skin cells turn over they contain antioxidants that help keep the skin renewed and refreshed and those can help keep those spots away as well also ingredients like sepiwhite can be very helpful in keeping your skin more even in tone

how soon is it safe to get pregnant after stopping birth control,when it comes to hormonal contraceptives your best bet is to complete your current cycle and then attempt to get pregnant says frank a chervenak md professor and chairman of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at weill medical college of cornell university in new york city after the cycle attempts can be made to start getting pregnant although it may be advisable to wait for the first normal menstrual period after you stop taking your pills  he says but this precaution is not essential some women conceive within a week or two after stopping birth control pills i advise women to complete the cycle so they do not have irregular bleeding  he says in general the middle of the month is when ovulation and potentially conception are most likely to take place so the optimal fertile window is a couple of weeks after stopping contraception an important point to consider however is that if there has been a previous pregnancy or miscarriage wait about three months to give the body a chance to recover  he says this is where a waiting period makes sense  as far as other types of contraception the intrauterine device iud must be removed before a woman starts attempting to conceive he says couples can just stop using condoms when they are ready to conceive he adds

what causes prostate cancer,the cause of prostate cancer is unknown but the cancer is not thought to be related to benign prostatic hyperplasia bph the risk predisposing factors for prostate cancer include advancing age genetics heredity hormonal influences and such environmental factors as toxins chemicals and industrial products the chances of developing prostate cancer increase with age thus prostate cancer under age 40 is extremely rare while it is common in men older than 80 years of age as a matter of fact some studies have suggested that among men over 80 years of age 50 80 of them may have prostate cancer more than 80 of prostate cancers are diagnosed in men older than 65 years of age african american men are 1 6 times more likely than white men to develop prostate cancer they are also 2 4 times more likely to die from their disease as compared to white men of a similar age these differences in diagnosis and death rates are however more likely to reflect a difference in factors such as environmental exposure diet lifestyle and health seeking behavior rather than any racial susceptibility to prostate cancer recent studies indicate that this disparity is progressively decreasing with chances of complete cure in men undergoing treatment for organ confined prostate cancer cancer that is limited to within the prostate without spread outside the confines of the prostate gland irrespective of race genetics heredity as just mentioned plays a role in the risk of developing a prostate cancer prostate cancer is more common among family members of individuals with prostate cancer this risk may be two to three times greater than the risk for men without a family history of the disease earlier age at diagnosis <60 years in a first degree relative father or brother and disease affecting more than one relative also increases the risk for developing prostate cancer testosterone the male hormone produced by the testicles directly stimulates the growth of both normal prostate tissue and prostate cancer cells not surprisingly therefore this hormone is thought to be involved in the development and growth of prostate cancer the important implication of the role of this hormone is that decreasing the level of testosterone should be and usually is effective in inhibiting the growth of prostate cancer recent evidence has suggested that sexually transmitted infections are risk factors for developing prostate cancer men with a history of sexually transmitted infections have a 1 4 times greater chance of developing prostate cancer as compared men without this history although still unproven environmental factors such as cigarette smoking and diets that are high in saturated fat seem to increase the risk of prostate cancer there is also a suggestion that obesity leads to an increased risk of having more aggressive larger prostate cancer which results in a poorer outcome after treatment additional substances or toxins in the environment or from industrial sources might also promote the development of prostate cancer but these have not yet been clearly identified geographical influences

is 3 too old to have a bottle  my 3 year old step son is still using a bottle at bedtime we got him off the bottle for nap time but my fiance believes that his son will not go to sleep at night without a bottle the mother does not seem at all interested in taking the bottle away i just want to know if it is okay that he still has a bottle at night or if we need to take it from him while we have him for our week and inform the mother that we have done this,a three year old should not be using a bedtime bottle so i have two suggestions 1 switch the contents of the bottle to water no milk bad for the teeth 2 use a low flow nipple so that he will really have to work at it to get any think out when you wash those nipples it would not be harmful to forget to wash off some of the residual soap 3 buy his bottles with money or a toy have him throw them away when the garbage truck comes let him toss them in the bin or truck and watch them go away to the dump 4 finally make him go cold turkey you will have a few very difficult nights as he screams and protests do it on the weekend and by monday he will be fine you on the other hand may need psychological help

my doctor asks me to get a tetanus vaccine upon an injury when i am doubtful of acquiring tetanus  is this anti tetanus vaccine if so for how long do these vaccines are effective some say it for three months or for six months is it okay if one gets this vaccine before twenty four hours of injury,the tetanus vaccine is good for ten years but some medical providers will recommend a booster vaccine sooner than that if there is some doubt as to the previous date or if the wound is particularly prone the disease tetanus is very rare in the united states not so rare in other countries but if you should get it it has an extremely high fatality rate getting a vaccine every ten years for 100 protection is really the best deal out there in the vaccine world getting the vaccine 24 hours before a planned injury   is unlikely to be very effective unless of course you have prior immunity from a previous tetanus still on board

vitamin d level was 15 my doctor prescribed 50 000 iu every other day details are below so my vitamin d level was 15 last year i did nothing about it unfortunately but i was  always sleepy   i would take long naps during the day  i can not concentrate   anxious  knee pain once in a while it starts hurting and feeling really stiff goes away with rest i feel bad because i am in college and i do not have time for this i have lots of work to do do you guys think this is because of my vitamin d levels also what other tests should i do to determine the cause thanks a lot,i do not know what you mean by you do not have time for this  curing a vitamin d deficiency is as easy as taking a pill once a day low vitamin d levels have been associated with bone pain general muscle weakness and even cancer thought that is unlikely in a young person it is doubtful your sleepiness and lack of concentration are due to vitamin d deficiency but i suppose anything is possible you do not need any other test to determine the cause of your low vitamin d levels it is pretty simple you are not consuming enough vitamin d and you are not getting enough sunlight on your skin this is a very common problem on the one hand we medical professionals tell people to wear sunscreen on the other hand we tell them they are deficient in vitamin d the solution is to continue wearing sunscreen when you go in the sun for prolonged periods of time and to take vitamin d supplements if you have no personal or family history of skin cancer you probably are safe to get 15 30 minutes of sun per day on your skin this will help boost your vitamin d levels given how very deficient you are in vitamin d i hope you took the prescribed 50 000 iu of vitamin d every other day until the prescription was gone the usual length of therapy is a couple of weeks you should get re tested if you have not already done so and then you may need to continue taking inexpensive vitamin d supplements for awhile until your levels are within normal range please note you should not continue taking 50 000 iu of vitamin d indefinitely that is a very large dose if you have any questions consult your health care provider wishing you well i do not believe the answer is always so cut and dry my vitmain d level has been low and getting lower for at least 5 years now i do not tolerate the heat or sunshine so i do not get very much sun but i have been pushing myself to tolerate it but i have been on several very high courses of good quality vitamin d supplements and the mainstays of my diet are all vitamin d rich but there was never even a slight rise in my levels at last check my levels were in the single digits incidentally i am always tired and always in pain these days absolutely i have had similar symptoms along with cardiac and autoimmune disorders my vitamin d level is 13 and has runned low for years i too never worried about vitamin d but i have found out that it is a huge problem and runs in my family related to synthesis problems of vitamins and enzymes have levels check regularly even after normal labs and please take your vitamin d with lots of sunshine and diet rich in vitamin d c

should i take the p7c3 pill for brain growth stimulation  i have been reading that this pill protects and sustains growth of neruons in the brain but i see no side affects listing is it safe for the general public,most helpful answer in a word no the compound p7c3 is still being tested in mice it is nowhere near being proven safe or effective for use in human beings i am not even sure you can buy this compound anywhere    not even on the internet that is probably because it does not actually exist as a medication yet but if you do find something in a store or online labeled as p7c3 my advice is beware it should not contain actual p7c3 which as i said is experimental so you will have no idea what those capsules contain if p7c3 pans out as something effective for human brains you can expect to see a pill on the market in 10 years or so meanwhile you can consult the webmd brain and nervous system center for tips on how to maintain a healthy brain hope this helps
when i dont eat for more than 3 hours i shake get hot flashes and pass out my sugar levels are normal when checked uptaking sugar when this happens was my doctors advice but it does not always help if i do not eat within ten minutes of this shaking and hot flashing then i pass out for over an hour my blood pressure is lower and so is my pulse my daily resting rate is 10471 and hr of 58 65 neither of which my physician was concerned with my temperature runs in the normal from 96 97 f shaking intensifies if i use my muscles when resting i fell no shaking only if i move  why,most helpful answer so sorry you are going through this it sounds scary even if your blood sugar levels tested normal during a routine lab test that does not mean you are not having episodes of hypoglycemia when you say my sugar levels are normal when checked  i am assuming you are talking about a lab test have you ever used a hand held glucometer to have someone check your sugar level when you experience one of these shakingsweatingpassing out episodes the reason your doctor specifically said to eat something sugary when this happens is to rapidly raise your low blood sugar levels it is not enough to eat just anything when these episodes occur carry a candy bar or something very sugary with you to eat when you start to feel these symptoms coming on passing out for over an hour can indicate dangerously low blood sugar levels you should not allow that to continue if you experience an episode like this again and your friends cannot rouse you wake you up they need to call 911 immediately i would strongly recommend going back to the doctor to have your symptoms reevaluated if eating sugar is not helping when you have one of these episodes by the way your blood pressure and pulse numbers look very good which is why your doctor was not concerned i hope this helps

does mrsa have any link at all to group b strep,i am not sure what you mean by link  if you are asking whether the two bacteria are related the answer is no  if you are asking can one lead to another the answer also is no  let me explain mrsa stands for methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureas a nasty bacterium that resists treatment by many antibiotic drugs interestingly mrsa can reside peaceably on the skin and a few other places such as the nasal passages in some people without ever causing a problem this is called colonization  the problem arises when mrsa invades internal tissues such as through a cut or surgery a mrsa infection presents a serious health issue that requires a strong response from medical professionals group b streptococcus lives in the intestines of many people and never causes a problem that said it is a leading cause of blood and brain infections in newborns infants are susceptible to group b strep because they do not have well developed immune systems when a baby gets infected with group b strep it often happens during the birthing process as these bacteria can be present in the vagina or rectum of the woman giving birth if a woman is known to be colonized with group b strep she may receive antibiotics during labor however these two bacteria are not in any way related if a person were diagnosed with both mrsa and group b strep at the same time it would be coincidental the only possible link between the two would be a weakened or suppressed immune system a person with a weakened immune system would be less able to fight off any type of bacterial infection and so this person would be more likely to come down with multiple infections caused by different bacteria wishing you well

does using an elliptical machine at the gym burn more calories than running on the street or bike riding,the answer depends on many different things since your weight the type of exercise how intense you are doing each exercise and how long you do each exercise will all influence how many calories you burn simply put however i would say that you have the potential to burn the most calories by running followed by biking and lastly by using the elliptical one way to measure how many calories you burn during exercise is to look at metabolic equivalents mets mets are a way to measure and gauge the amount of energy you burn during physical activity with 1 met being equal to the energy you burn simply being at rest for instance running at a 10 minute mile pace is roughly the equivalent of 10 mets or ten times the calories you burn at rest unfortunately there really is no good answer for how many mets you burn while using an elliptical a study entitled 鈥2011 compendium of physical activities a second update of codes and met values鈥 only lists using an elliptical at a moderate intensity which was the equivalent of 5 mets for comparison bicycling with a moderate effort 12 13 9mph is 8 mets you can find a comprehensive list of mets by doing an internet search for 鈥渃ompendium of physical activities tracking guide鈥 websites utilizing a formula involving these met values for each type of exercise along with your weight and the duration can help to estimate how many calories you will burn during exercise keep in mind that these are just based off of averages but one such site is <link> play around with the types of activities and the duration of the activity to see what can provide you with the most calories burned

what are the side effects and benefits of male celibacy including masturbation i e no orgasms  i have begun what i call a complete celibacy not allowing myself any sexual stimulation or release with or without a partner i have found a dearth of information online about the medical side of celibacy but a lot relating to religion,i do not believe that a personal choice to be celibate has any medical consequences while humans are inherently sexual beings celibacy does not cause disease it does require an strong conviction however i have done a fair amount of non religious research on this and the answer is that the body will eventually get used to complete celibacy after a while you might have a wet dream even if you do not your sperm will eventually reabsorb into your body you might get prostatits if you are used to having release and suddenly go down to nothing and epididymitis is also possible though less common you also might find prostate fluid oozing out of you when you defaecate after a while you do want to be clear in your reasons for doing this however any time you do something that is not natural like not ejaculating at all even if it is not harmful you want to know why if it is to please a partner for instance then make sure it pleases you too otherwise resentment and other problems will build up if it is because of guilt or shame issues have those taken care of you will be happier and healthier i am not judging or presuming anything i just wanted to mention this as a friendly reminder

lumbar puncture complications i had a lumbar puncture done in my local er 4 days ago to rule out meningitis i have had severe neck pain at the time for 8 days with a headache bp was 157110 when the med student at the hands of the er physician took 6 tries to get it in the right place she then hit a tendon the er dr asked her if she heard that pop and explained to her she hit a tendon could this be why i am still very sore at the sight shouldnt they have explained this to me,thank goodness you apparently do not have meningitis how scary in answer to your last question yes i think the er doctor should have explained to you exactly what to expect after your lumbar puncture in fact you should have received some sort of written instructions beyond that i think they should have given you additional verbal information about what to expect due to experiencing six attempts it is possible the site is still sore because of multiple tries and because of hitting a tendon however if you begin to run a fever it is time to seek medical attention fever could be a sign of infection lumbar punctures are performed under sterile conditions but infection can occur after the fact i do not think four days of soreness at the puncture site is unreasonable but if you are concerned you might give your primary care provider a call it never hurts no pun intended to get these things checked out i hope you feel better soon also you should know that after a spinal tap you are supposed to rest at least 24 hours after having the procedure i have had viral meningitis before so when i have similar symptoms the er doctor will give me a spinal tap thankfully those have come up negative unfortunately the first spinal tap i had after have the viral meningitis no one told me i was supposed to rest for 24 hours and i went to church 6 hours later i was back in the er 2 hours after church wanted to stay to teach sunday school before going back to the hospital make sure to always ask questions

can pacemaker lead cause a chest muscle twitch i have a st jude pacemaker and lift weights i just started getting a muscle twitch in my left pectorail muscle it is very random and it does not seem to affect my heart rate is this common or should i have it checked,while it is possible for people to experience muscle stimulation from pacemakers it is typically the diaphragm as it lies close the the right ventricle which is actually being paced while i can not diagnose the cause of your muscle twitching in this forum i would guess that left pectoralis stimulation would be pretty unlikely particularly if it does not seem related to your heart rate always helpful to get checked out by your doctor if you have any concerns

what medications can i talk to my pain management doctor about to help with my sciatica and constant migraines  i am 24 years old with really bad sciatica and migraines i am seeing a pain management doctor and for now he has me on a compound cream which does nothing he talked about doing steroid shots and from everything i have read it is all been negative because they are not fda approve for the use of epidural pain relief i hate that my doctors look at me like i am a drug seeker because of me age i want to play with my son again without pain thanks in advance courtney,courtney let is answer your opening question honestly and directly the pain management doctor probably does not want to talk with you about medications you could discuss hydrocodone but will most likely be dismissed there is a reluctance by most pain management doctors to prescribe pain relief medication due to potential law suits yes some patients actually sue the doctor and win for causing a drug addiction unscrupulous patients who are actively addicted or those scoundrels who will sell the drugs my orthopedic doctor referred me to a pain management physician for severe sciatic type pain and lower back pain a bulging disc was confirmed through mri studies at l and s1 during my first pain management visit i was given a spinal injection of cortisone the doctor told me that it might not work so upon leaving the office i asked the r n if there was something else that could be prescribed if the procedure failed she flippantly told me to take an advil as the practice did not prescribe medicine and that narcotics would not work on nerve pain what an uncaring incompetent statement by a registered nurse or more likely it was just an outright lie on the 2nd visit i underwent a spinal epidural process both treatment modalities failed miserably and left me in excoriating pain i tried physical therapy ice packs a heating pad motion 800 mg 4x is a day and slept on an 18 wooden board without relief i returned to my orthopedic surgeon who prescribed hydrocodone 5 w325 tylenol taking three pills at bedtime actually helps additionally he scheduled me to see an orthopedic surgeon at the first available appointment during the end of august 2014 to evaluate my condition for surgical consideration i am relating my story to confirm the facts outlined in your question in 2014 many doctors are fearful of prescribing narcotic medications to a 24 year old person or even a 65 year old person something needs to change in the practice of pain management doctors take a sacred oath to do no harm i suggest that sending a patient away in severe pain without an adequate treatment pain is causing harm and goes against the principles and spirit of causing no harm i suggest that you find a doctor willing to treat your pain with medication sufficient to relieve the pain at the same time seek out a cause for your pain and have the appropriate treatment completed to resolve your condition without continuing to take pain medication no legitimate pain suffer should be forced to jump out of their skin cry in agony or find a drug supplier on the street there are surgical remedies acupuncture and implanted pain control pumps to alleviate even the most torturous pain

how can my crock pot help me make fast healthy food,it is starting to come back in vogue to utilize a slow cooker or crock pot in general i am someone who likes to get great healthy food on the table fast i do not always do well with things that are slow however the amount of time it takes to prepare ingredients for the slow cooker is fast and i like that you do not have to think about it again until it is time to eat here are some tips on ways to revitalize flavor reverse bad past crock pot experiences and have a healthy savory meal that is not an overcooked pile of mush the first and most important tip to having a delicious crock pot meal is to choose the right type of ingredients this is where you should utilize ingredients that take longer to cook like traditionally tough cuts of meat these include brisket pork butt or an entire chicken by the way these are traditionally less expensive meats so if you are trying to budget for meals this is a great way to help with that 鈥 or if you are trying to budget for organic ingredients this is where you can upgrade to organic or natural cuts of meat  when cooked for so many hours these tougher meats taste great and fall off the bone easily and you get the added benefit of pulling nutrients from the bone if you have had a bad experience with a crock pot most likely you have participated in the biggest mistake do not use canned vegetables in a slow cooker period ever using canned vegetables in a crock pot recipe will simply turn your meal into a vegetable smoothie canned vegetables are already overcooked when they are put in the can cooking them for another 6 8 hours will disintegrate them potatoes carrot onions and other firm veggies do well in a slow cooker using canned tomatoes is fine 鈥 mostly because you will probably be using them in a sauce so they hold up well absolute no nos canned green beans canned corn and canned peas actually let me go ahead and advise you to never use these canned vegetables if you can help it under seasoning is another mistake i see people make all the time since the food is cooking there for so long 鈥 the equivalent of a long slow boil 鈥 there needs to be a few levels of flavors there are a couple ways to do this if you are making a meat or bean dish i suggest saut茅ing savories like onions shallots or garlic in extra virgin olive oil first before you put in the crock pot the flavors seep into the oil better if you take this extra step also add fresh cut herbs at the very end or a squeeze of lemon or lime to brighten up the dish and give fresh flavor quickly add ingredients that are high in flavor for example fire roasted tomatoes

is it safe to push through fibromyalgia pain  every time i even attempt to do any sort of exercise the pain does not really allow me to do anything i used to be an athlete many years ago and i would just push through the pain or keep going until the pain went away i have not been able to work for years since my accident and fibromyalgia and it is very frustrating  i am wondering if i can do any damage to my body if i push through the pain  is it safe to force my body to work through the pain and attempt exercise,i have tried both ways and i believe that exercise to almost to the point and then draw back pushing though seemed to prolong my pain and definitely added to it if you do push to hard then i would suggest that you immediately or as soon as possible be kind to your body with warm water soaks i know it is frustrating when you are used to pushing through your body pain to do and be what you want but there are painful consequences it could cause you to be unable to do anything i just know that pacing yourself is the watch word here pacing yourself is a somewhat vague statement but it means to not to use all your energy doing one thing especially if you want to have other things in your life it is harder to do than say and requires practice we have athletes who do marathons and other difficult sport activities i hope this help start slow when they say 1 or 2 minutes they mean it but soon your body will be able to tolerate it at most times and never never think if you have to take a break because of a flare up that you can just pick up where you started before the flare up start slower and build back up i have found that individual type sports like hiking swimming the non contact sports seem to be best as it is easier to do that pacing i was talking about good luck hope this helps and do not forget to stretch

will calcium supplement help to heal broken bones faster what will speed the healing  2 broken bones in the right hand of my sixteen year old son the break is vertical so less likely to shift,i can see why it might sound logical that calcium supplementation could help broken bones heal faster after all bones are made of calcium right so feeding them calcium should speed up healing unfortunately that is not how it works unless you have a pre existing calcium deficiency not likely in an otherwise healthy 16 year old boy taking calcium will not help your bones heal the process of bone healing is called remodeling  your body removes dead bone cells and builds new ones in their place this process occurs on a pretty predictable schedule for common fractures like the one you describe the remodeling process normally takes 6 to 8 weeks unfortunately your son will just have to wait this out what will help the bones heal on schedule is not engaging in activities that put stress on the areas of the fracture resting the hand to keep the fractures stable will allow the body to do its remodeling job and get the bones back to normal wishing you well

how can i prepare potatoes healthfully,potato cakes seem like a strange thing to write about especially on a site dedicated to health i had a grandmother who made really unappetizing potato cakes when i was growing up so i discounted them for years what i have come to realize is that they can be a healthy fantastic side dish to almost any meal i had potato cakes on the menu this weekend with our fish special at catelli is restaurant and they were so delicious versatile and surprisingly healthy first start with organic yukon gold potatoes or sweet potatoes or a combination of the two decide if you want to add vegetables like shredded zucchini i start by shredding the potatoes on a blade in the cuisinart or by grating them on a box grater next take a bowl and toss the potatoes with fresh herbs there are plenty that add great flavor鈥 rosemary and thyme are two of my favorites add savories like shallot onion and garlic i like to saut茅 my finely chopped onion and garlic first in a bit of extra virgin olive oil and a pinch of hot pepper flakes  put the shredded potatoes herbs and vegetable in a bowl and fold in the cooked onions and garlic then season with salt and cracked black pepper heat the oven 450 degrees from there line a baking sheet with parchment paper and for each cake make about a cupcake size mass spread them out equally on the sheet pan drizzle a bit more olive oil on top for extra browning and then bake for about 15 20 minutes these cakes a great side dish with all proteins are really simple to make they make weeknight meals into something more interesting and you can be as creative or simple as you want a few additional ideas add cilantro and chopped jalapeno for a latin flair add some parmesan and extra garlic to a cake with rosemary crushed coriander and some curry powder can lend to indian flavors whatever you choose to do have fun with it

would it be painful to take a few stitches off after 3 4weeks  i have had my stitches in for about 3 weeks almost and i am just wondering if it would be better to remove them now or wait until my cut is fully healed i pulled out 5 stitches on my own after 2 weeks and it hurt a lot so will it hurt to remove the remaining ones after 3 4 weeks,i have no idea where you had stitches or the extent of your laceration repair facial sutures should be removed in just a few days rarely over five days and the wound reinforced by special tape extremity sutures can stay 7 10 days deeper wounds may require longer but it would be unusual for that recommendation to exceed three weeks this is really up to the medical provider who sutured you you should not be leaving most sutures in for as long as have nor should you be taking them out yourself unless you were instructed how to do so and when i have no idea if this will hurt i do not have enough information nor do i know your skill level of doing this
sex toys and chlamydia how long would chlamydia cells be alive on sex toys i tested positive for chlamydia after my bf cheated i got treated but a few days later without thinking i picked up a sex toy which is not inserted just a stimulator and for a second it went in my mouth i realised and threw it away is there anyway that there were alive cells or infection from vaginal fluid which could dried and not been washed off that would still be alive after a few days or would the infection have died by then,it used to be said that when it dried it died but that is not always true for some micro organisms which can remain dormant for hours or even days after being contaminated sexual toys would need to be appropriately disinfected before using them again just in case in your posted scenario you are probably fine it is wise to be cautious and every wiser to have any future partner use a condom

touched same pen paper & car surface as man with shingles which i have had my husband & teen niecenephew never had pox man with shingles says his shingles are 2 3 weeks old my husband is 51 and has copd & tachycardia & had pneumonia several times a few years back his nephew has aspergers & autism & his niece has belly something with the liver she is on the waiting list for one in utah going on 19 years old they said she would never live past 9  and she takes tons of meds so  are they at risk if i was in same room as them & if i touched things in the house and they touch it too what are the risks,ok so let is back up a moment and run through what shingles is how it gets transmitted and what effect it has on different groups of people shingles is caused by the varicella virus this is the same virus that causes chickenpox you cannot get shingles unless you have had chickenpox if you have had chickenpox you cannot catch shingles from coming in contact with someone who has shingles however people who never had chickenpox and have not been vaccinated for it can get chickenpox by coming into contact with the active weeping blisters of someone with shingles once the blisters crust over they are generally considered to be non infectious it is uncommon for people to develop chickenpox from exposure to shingles under any circumstances and i would think it nearly impossible under the circumstances you describe i can understand why you feel the need to take serious precautions but i think your loved ones can rest easy i doubt you could carry the shingles virus to them especially from indirect contact with someone whose rash is at least two weeks old wishing you well

what is the likelihood that a 4 year old child allergic to cats will also be allergic to dogs  does it matter whether the catsdogs are male or female are some breeds of dog more allergenic than others if the symptom includes a puffy face which is not usual for her cat reactions could this be due to exposure to a dog or other allergenic,cats and dogs are different species but many higher allergic children are allergic to many animal danders to be sure just ask the medical provider for a blood test for cat dander as well longer haired dogs have more dander than the bald ones and there are some breeds that shed very little and are tauted as hypo allergenic dogs but i am skeptical the sex of the dog should not make a difference i never met a child that was only allergic to male dogs and not females etc w when an allergic person reacts and starts showing signs of allergy itching hives sneezing wheezing swelling etc  we often blame the last thing they did something they ate touched inhaled or encountered but that is only circumstantial a child with allergies typically is allergic to many things including some things that were not even tested if you are being pressured to get a pet a dog or a cat it is best to be tested first before you acquire and animal and become attached to it

my 4 year old is on abilify we upped his dose a couple weeks ago and he started stuttering is this from the meds,there are no studies of aripiprazole    or any other psychiatric drugs for that matter    in children under 10 that does not mean we never use medicines in children under 10 but it does mean that the prescribing doctor needs to be extremely thoughtful about what they think they are treating and be very clear to the parents in explaining possible risks versus benefits small children have immature livers and so it is quite possible even a tiny dose of medicine will last longer than in an adolescent or adult abilify itself has a very long half life 2 weeks so may hang around for many weeks after it is stopped in such a small child presumably the doctor was using the smallest possible doses eg 2 mgday stuttering is not a commonly known side effect in adults but could reflect effects of aripiprazoleon the ability to control tongue or mouth muscles hopefully you are seeing an excellent child psychiatrist who knows what they are doing and who has experience is so unusual a use of a medicine like this and they should be able to guide you

does using an elliptical machine at the gym burn more calories than running on the street or bike riding,running will burn more calories than the elliptical although it is pretty close about 100 calories per hour difference some of the difference is due to the pounding of running and the fact that you propel your body through the air so that both feet are off the ground simultaneously this kind of movement takes lots of energy both the elliptical and running burn substantially more calories than the bike at the same level of perceived exertion about 200 240 calories per hour more in a classic study comparing energy expenditure of exercise machines the order of calories burned from highest to lowest is posted below the elliptical was not studied in this research but it would fit between rowing and cross country skiing it should be noted that rowing the elliptical and cross country skiing are all very close in calorie expenditure with probably not more than 100 125 calories per hour difference among them  treadmill walkingrunning stair stepping rowing cross country skiing biking stationary now this is not to say that exercises that burn the fewest calories are all bad to the contrary you can get a great workout and burn lots of calories doing any of them you would be hard pressed to say that lance armstrong is not fit he is one of the fittest human beings alive and he did it by biking the point is that if you work hard enough on any of the exercise machines and you work up a sweat and you get your heart rate into your training zone then your heart lungs and muscles are not going to know the difference bottom line is that you will get fit and healthy using any of the machines if you use them consistently and with sufficient intensity one final note there is error in estimating energy expenditure on most if not all exercise machines in some cases it can be as high as 25 percent the machine overestimates how many calories you burn there are simply too many variables for the machine to give you an accurate number and so you need to keep that in mind during weight loss efforts if you are calculating how many calories to eat based on your energy expenditure the answer depends on many different things since your weight the type of exercise how intense you are doing each exercise and how long you do each exercise will all influence how many calories you burn simply put however i would say that you have the potential to burn the most calories by running followed by biking and lastly by using the elliptical one way to measure how many calories you burn during exercise is to look at metabolic equivalents mets mets are a way to measure and gauge the amount of energy you burn during physical activity with 1 met being equal to the energy you burn simply being at rest for instance running at a 10 minute mile pace is roughly the equivalent
3 yr old son said he ate quarter 5 days ago i have been checking his poop and still nothing now what  my son came to me and said  he ate the money i could not find the quarter anywhere we did not see him eat it and he was not chocking i did some research and we decided to wait to see if it passed on its own it has now been 5 days and still nothing i hate to expose my son to unnecessary x rays he is acting completely normal pooping eating playing do i need t to bring him in or should we just roll with it its hard because we do not know if he actually ate it,a quarter is quite big but i have seem them harmlessly pass assuming that he did indeed swallow a quarter short of an x ray a safe and inexpensive way to find out if your three year old has a metallic coin is with a metal detector you can rent one or find out if you have a friend who may own one if a metal detector can not get a signal he probably did not swallow it if he suddenly becomes constipated or vomits you may have to expose him to a very low level abdominal x ray    one view only and it would not be harmful

18 years old already have 2 kids can i get a hysterectomy  i am 18 years old i already have 2 kids and i do not want anymore my period is extremely painful and heavy will a doctor give me a hysterectomy or am i to young,it would be highly unlikely for any surgeon or an insurance company that would pay for this elective procedure to agree that a hysterectomy is the way to go at this point it is not just your age that is a contributing factor but a hysterectomy is not medically indicated in most cases just because you have two kids and your periods are heavypainful see your gynecologist and i am sure there are other solutions to answer your concerns that are considerably less riskier than removing your uterus thank you for asking with the age of just 18 i am afraid going for hysterectomy is unwise although possible procedures like hysterectomy are permanent and there is no coming back and depression and other psychological accidents are common in such women as well also there is a long life ahead for you you may wanna change your mind to have another child due to any reason and then you will need a uterus to conceive so my suggestion is do not opt for it unless you have some severe problem with uterus like heavy periods etc hysterectomy can wait till 35 years or older age i hope it helps regards dr s khan ehealthdesk

my teen has anxiety which is controlled by medication but dr wants to take him off the medication why is this safe  my son was having hallucinations and was given antipsychotic meds 18 mos ago 8 mos ago he was dx with anxiety and rx anxiety meds he has not had hallucinations since 2 months ago dr stopped antipsych meds he is currently taking anxiety meds hes doing very well and still no hallucinations dr wants to lower dose of anxiety meds til he is no longer on med his anixety was so severe it caused hallucinations is it possible for a teen to outgrow anxiety to the point no med is necessary,often medications taken over a period of time tend not to effective since your son seems to be doing better there is no need to continue medications as they are the doctor is doing the right thing by reducing medicatipns to the lowest effective level it is much better to dose down than to dose up too mich medication when not needed can be detrimental be happy your son is showing signs of improvrment which is not always the case patrick4287

how did my 1 year old get scabbies he is not in day care started off looking like flea bites or something on his legs every few days a few more would pop up he has about 15 20 bites after a week or two i started getting these bites he is not in a daycare except on sundays in the nursery is scabies something he had to get passed to himor how is it accrued by the first person in order to pass it also i found the return air duct under the house is on the ground after it rained it filled my home with a musty dirt smell could this have done it,scabies assuming he was accurately diagnosed is a human parasite it is passed on to him by another human it could be from someone the cares for him at the sunday nursery or it did not come from the faulty air duct
how do you break a fever on a two year old and when should i take her to the hospital if i cant get it to break she has had a fever for two days now so far the highest temp being 101 3f now its around 100f and i cant get it to break with meds ive tried a cool bath still nothing she also has a cough with the fever could it be because he two year mollers are coming in idk what to do i never had this problem with my son,a fever is the body is natural way of fighting an infection a fever does not need to be broken or even treated especially a low grade fever like 101 3 i see children every day with fevers in the 104 105 range no problems no brain damage and no need to really treat them unless you do so clearly for comfort did you know that cool baths can actually increase the fever when the thermal sensors on the skin detect that the child is cold the brain will respond and attempt to increase body heat fever is good and should not be feared with that said the cause of the fever cannot be determined unless the child has a proper medical examination a hospital er is really not the best place and you will likely wait and wait and wait until you are seen since mildly ill people go the back of the line go to an urgent care facility if you want or you can just wait it out please spend some time and re educate yourself about the medical benefits of fever in children i can assure you that it is quite different than what you mother or grandmother taught you to believe

what is the outlook for children with arthritis,with proper therapy the children with arthritis will usually improve over time indeed the vast majority of children with arthritis grow up to lead normal lives without significant difficulty even for severe cases with proper medications proper physical and occupational therapy and proper surgery if necessary virtually no one with arthritis should need a wheelchair everyone is doctor knows stories of children who looked awful but did very well or looked like it was nothing serious  who became very sick but these are the rare exceptions there are many recent significant improvements in treating children with arthritis for over 95 of the children with arthritis today we do not need new drugs or miraculous inventions we just need proper application of the resources we already have there are three important things for every child or adolescent with arthritis first is proper recognition and diagnosis of the disease second is proper treatment by an experienced physician with multidisciplinary support including physical and occupational therapists and orthopedic surgeons third is proper education of the patient and family people with arthritis are no different than everyone else in the world they all need to grow up have jobs get married and have families some will have some difficulty with mechanical problems many will have small things they can not do if you watch them carefully few will go on to be professional athletes or military officers but even fewer will be totally disabled by their disease there are far more children who are disabled because they are told they could not do things than children who are really disabled by their disease we should never accept a child with arthritis being told to use a wheelchair in almost every case it is hoped that we will be able to correct the problem and get them walking again this is why educating the public and physicians is so important it must be appreciated that children can develop arthritis and must be properly diagnosed and treated each child should be able to reach his or her full potential children with arthritis should be treated just like everyone else they need the same discipline the same allowance the same grades and the same respect as all the other children arthritis might affect the body but it must never be allowed to affect the mind
when do i use an antacid versus an h2 blocker versus a proton pump inhibitor,that is a great question and it all depends on how frequent your heartburn is if you just have an occasional bout of heartburn for instance you ate a spicy meal then you can use a regular antacid a maalox or a mylanta product you want to make sure though that you shake it really well a lot of people forget about that also too if you are taking medications you may need to space it either take it an hour before you take your medications or two hours afterwards because it can actually bind to the medicine and therefore the medicine will not work as well if you notice though that you have like two days in a row where you have had consistent heartburn then you may want to try a h2 blocker pepcid is one consideration zantac you want to talk to your pharmacist though and let us know if you are taking any other medications zantac has a tendency to interact with other medicines so if you have your medication list handy we can take a look at it and make sure there is no potential for drug interactions if it is two or more episodes a week that you are experiencing heartburn then you are going to want to go towards the proton pump inhibitor and prilosec otc is an example of that you want to use it for 14 days but once again you want to talk to your pharmacist to make sure that you are not taking any other medicines or possibly taking any duplicate medicines that could do the same thing then also if you are not feeling well after the 14 days a pharmacist is probably going to refer you back to your doctor or healthcare provider because it probably needs a little bit more evaluation
why are men is bathrooms so dirty,according to a recent study 85 percent of americans are washing their hands after using a public bathroom improved from 77 percent a few years ago the other 15 percent are contaminating the rest of our world nearly three times as many women wash their hands than men however apparently men have a prevailing assumption that if you do not pee on your fingers you do not need to wash your hands personally i am not overly worried about the pee guys but i do worry about the men behind those stall doors men is restrooms are considerably nastier than the women is facilities so i am told if i am forced to use a public restroom i try not to touch anything if i can help it i consider bathrooms stalls the most contaminated rooms on this planet i would love to put on some type of biological hazard suit but this is not practical i have seen impatient dancing women quickly use a men is room when the line to the women is restroom is too long it only takes one of these experiences to truly appreciate the difference for the first time i would like to reveal the inner workings of a typical men is room there is usually a bank of urinals against one wall about five men do not like to stand side by side with another man peeing so whenever possible an unused urinal becomes the 鈥渂uffer 鈥 some urinals have little walls between them but most are open there may or may not be a lower urinal for little boys in the stalls i would be shocked not to find urine on the seat even though urine is usually sterile no one wants to ever sit on it men like urinals sort of but little boys do not they are either too short to use them or too shy given a choice little boys head for the stall where they will freely pee on the seat the floor and the flush handle before finding their mark i would be shocked not to find sticky urine on the floor near the toilet men do not like to sit on strange toilets given the choice they prefer the one at home well stocked with reading material unlike women men have not developed the fine art of toilet seat hovering men are accustomed to sitting down and reading for a while women typically pee and leave no one really knows the best toilet stall to use i guess the best one would be the handicap stall but that is not very nice to occupy most will use the stall most distant from the door however you do tend to select the one that looks the cleanest and has a flushed toilet if you must use a stall you really do not want to pick a stall next to an actively occupied one it can be disconcerting to hear all of those bathroom noises next door or
is there a downside to oral erection drugs,well the downside to these products is that there are side effects for example men that have certain high blood pressure disorders are taking nitrate medications if you mix these oral erection drugs with that you can drop your blood pressure and have a serious complication this is why men who take viagra levitra and cialis if after having sex they have a heart attack they have to tell the paramedics and er doctors they have this product in their systems because one of the first things the doctors will want to do is put nitrates into their blood to stabilize their heart and their blood pressure the combination can be deadly there can be some visual disorders one of the big side effects is that the drug really is not being used correctly for many men they are either not being given enough trials with it it sometimes takes several doses before it is effective they try it once and they say it is not going to work and they will go try something else the other thing is it is become very recreational a lot of guys who do not need it are taking it which raises some concerns why because it is almost become the thing to do you know you take the drug and you are guaranteed a good erection well if you had good erections before it probably will not help but it is just kind of a macho kind of a way of just kind of having fun the other concern is that for most men that have true erectile dysfunction that is a symptom of something far more serious whether it is diabetes hormone problems metabolic problems vascular disorders that is an early warning sign and by simply throwing viagra levitra cialis at them and not addressing the cause i am really doing them a lot of disservice if it is truly the first warning sign of potential coronary artery disease i mean if it is the first warning sign of coronary artery disease and you do not do the right workup the guy may get great erections but he may have a heart attack in a year or two that could have been prevented it is essential that you understand why it is you have erectile dysfunction some men just get it and that is the way that you are but you want to make sure that there is nothing serious that you are missing
can you take birth control pills to reduce acne if you already have the mirena iud  i have had the mirena iud for 3 years but have suffered from very severe acne since i have had it put in before getting the iud i was on desogen birth control pills and my skin was very clear  i like the iud because it makes me not bleed when i menstruate but i like desogen because it makes my skin very clear  is there a risk to taking these together,your gynecologist andor pharmacist can tell you about that if you are not getting too much hormone you could take both together   but your prescribing doctor would make that final decision alternatively you can ask your doctor or pharmacist what is in the mirena as well as what is in the desogen and see if the missing ingredient is available separately

why do i have heavy bleeding for 2 3 weeks when i get my period my doctor is supposed to send me for an ultrasound,there are two major reasons for very prolongedheavy periods hormonal and what i call structural  structural means when excessive bleeding is due to actual problems within the cavity or walls of the uterus some examples of this would include fibroids of the uterus endometriosis of the muscular wall of the uterus adenomyosis infections of the lining of the uterus polyps of the uterine lining or even uterine cancer hormonal causes are usually linked to missed or erratic ovulations as you may know in a normal cycle estrogen is produced all month estrogen is responsible for building up the lining of your uterus so you have something to shed each month in a normal cycle progesterone production increases following ovulation progesterone stabilizes the uterine lining in preparation for a possible implantation of a new pregnancy if you are not pregnant that month the levels of estrogen and progesterone fall triggering the release of the uterine lining鈥攜our period so if you do not ovulate the estrogen build up of the lining continues but without the usual ovulation associated progesterone thus the hormone levels do not decline and the lining stays up inside the uterus鈥攜our missedlate period alternatively the lining can begin to shed under its own weight producing prolonged bleeding another way inadequate progesterone production from missed ovulations can create too heavy a flow is as follows simply stated if the uterine lining is like grass or lawn estrogen is like the fertilizer causes proliferation and a thickening of the lining  and progesterone is like the lawnmower keeps the lining thin by three different mechanisms this is why depoprovera high dose synthetic progesterone brings about a thin lining and why birth control pills relatively progesterone dominant bring about shorter lighter periods it is also why women who miss ovulations no progesterone produced are at a greater risk for too thick lining causes for not ovulating are multifold thyroid problems pituitary problems ovarian cysts physical stressors e g sudden increases in exercise crash dieting emotional stressors problems with spouses kids job money increased body weight anorexia rotating shifts at work etc if they are sending you for an ultrasound that can accomplish two things an ultrasound should be able to visualize fibroids of the uterus or suggest polyps an ultrasound can also measure the thickness of your uterine lining a very thick lining can suggest a hormonal cause like missed ovulations an ultrasound should be able to visualize an ovarian cyst if that was the cause of missed ovulations lastly  as we age ovulations tend to decrease  or if they occur the amount of progesterone produced may be less structural causes such as fibroids or polyps also tend to be more common as we age hopefully you will get a more for sure answer after your ultrasound

how is peyronie is disease treated,there are two ways in which peyronie is disease can be treated surgery or non surgical treatment because the plaque of peyronie is disease often shrinks or disappears without treatment most doctors suggest waiting one to two years or longer before attempting to correct it with surgery in many cases surgery produces positive results but because complications can occur and because many of the problems associated with peyronie is disease for example shortening of the penis are not corrected by surgery most doctors prefer to perform surgery only on men with curvatures so severe that sexual intercourse is impossible there are two surgical techniques used to treat peyronie is disease one method involves the removal of the plaque followed by placement of a patch of skin or artificial material skin graft with the second technique the surgeon removes or pinches the tissue from the side of the penis opposite the plaque which cancels out the bending effect the first method can involve partial loss of erectile function especially rigidity the second method known as the nesbit procedure causes a shortening of the erect penis penile implants can be used in cases where peyronie is disease has affected the man is ability to achieve or maintain an erection a non surgical treatment for peyronie is disease involves injecting medication directly into the plaque in an attempt to soften the affected tissue decrease the pain and correct the curvature of the penis vitamin e pills haves also been shown to benefit some men with peyronie is disease another less invasive option is laser treatment to thin the plaques of peyronie is disease

if i am taking bactrim for a urinary tract infection is it okay to consume alcohol like 1 or 2 drinks,as a non drinker i do not feel anyone should consume alcohol while being treated with antibiotics but one or two drinks would probably not cause you any harm or adverse effects the most important thing for you to do while on bactrim is to drink plenty of water so if you will just follow those one or two drinks with a full glass or two of water you should be fine the most important thing is getting your uti properly treated excessive alcohol consumption can interfere with judgment and impair inhibitions impaired inhibitions can lead to sex and sex can lead to another urinary tract infection a vicious cycle

had a mole removed an now its red an very itchy the mole was on my forearm my doctor burned it off now it is red an very itchy whats causing it to do that,assuming you had this mole removed recently i would say the redness and itching are a normal part of the healing process as the body heals a wound in this case the one caused by having the mole burned off it employs several types of cells and chemical compounds to repair the skin layers that have been damaged during that process a chemical compound called histamine can be released histamine can cause itching along similar lines the redness can be caused by various cells and the body is chemical response to the wound it is important you not scratch this patch of skin while it is healing if you pull the scab off a scar can form it is ok to rub the area with the flat of your hand if you are concerned about scratching during your sleep put socks on your hands i know it sounds wacky but it will keep you from accidentally scratching your face with a fingernail while you sleep the itching and redness should calm down as the days pass if the redness and itching get worse you can put a call in to your doctor is office and speak with the nurse to find out what to do good luck
do i have a uti or std need help  i had sex with a girl and she told me during sex she had a uti afterwards it started to burn when i peed i went about a week like that and bought some medicine for a uti well the burning went away but i now experience shortness of bladder and noticed that when i have to go i do not really feel a relieving sense do i need to take more of the medication to clear this up all has occurred over the last month or so,men rarely get utis but men certainly get stds having unprotected sex since you are having symptoms it would be in your best interest to be properly examined and be checked for both chlamydia and gonorrhea a uti or std is not something you can self treat using over the counter medications
is there any treatment for chronic severe diarrhea after gall bladder removal,diarrhea is troubling in 10 of people who have their gallbladders removed the diarrhea is believed to be due to the fact that following removal of the gallbladder the intestines contain more bile acids than under normal conditions in which bile acids are stored for much of the day in the gallbladder bile acids cause diarrhea by promoting the secretion of fluid by the intestines and perhaps by stimulating the intestinal muscles to contract there are no good studies of treatment of this type of diarrhea but two treatments have been proposed and appear to be effective the first are medications for example cholestyramine that attach to bile acids in the intestine and prevent them from interacting with the intestine the second are fatty acid medications for example oleic acid that may act by slowing down the intestinal muscle and perhaps by reducing secretion of fluid although the exact mechanism of action of oleic acid in these patients has not been studied it is also important remember that there are many other causes of chronic severe diarrhea such as celiac sprue ulcerative colitis crohn is disease microscopic colitis and many more it is important to work with you doctor to arrive at a firm diagnosis for best treatment results

what is the difference between the symptoms of a cold and an ear infection,an earache from a cold can be a sharp dull or burning pain that can range from mild to very painful even if the trapped fluid in the ear is not infected the fluid puts pressure on the eardrum causing it to bulge and throb with an earache from a cold you or your child may have difficulty sleeping run a fever and have green or yellow mucus in the nose because colds are self limiting an earache with a cold usually goes away on its own still if you have an earache an ear infection may be likely which means you might need to see your doctor for a diagnosis and proper treatment while earaches can occur first with a cold virus sometimes a secondary ear infection may occur these ear infections are usually sudden in onset and extremely painful in the beginning that is because the sensory nerve endings in the eardrum respond to increased pressure with pain after the eardrum stretches a little the earache pain may ease up other symptoms of an earache from an ear infection may include the following loss of appetite this may be apparent in young children especially during bottle feedings pressure changes in the middle ear as the child swallows causing more pain irritability poor sleep pain may be more persistent when lying down as fluid is shifting fever ear infections can cause temperatures up to 104 degrees f vertigo you may have a sense of spinning drainage from the ear yellow brown or white fluid that is not earwax may seep from the ear indicating the eardrum has ruptured difficulty hearing fluid build up in the middle ear prevents the eardrum from functioning properly the sound is then unable to be transmitted to the bones of the middle ear and from there to the brain otitis media with effusion symptoms of acute otitis media will disappear but the fluid which is called an effusion may remain trapped fluid causes temporary and mild hearing loss

so is there a cure for seborrheic dermatitis  is there any truth to mayonnaise and vitamin e oil applied to affected areas curing this ailment,i am sorry you are suffering from this condition thankfully although it is unsightly and sometimes painful it is not life threatening there is no cure i am aware of for seborrheic dermatitis this condition causes scaly skin patches and flaking it also can cause pain you can see a dermatologist for more information and medications to treat seborrheic dermatitis there are prescription creams that can help calm flare ups there is no truth whatsoever to the claim that mayonnaise or vitamin e oil will cure seborrheic dermatitis it is possible applying an oil like vitamin e will improve the appearance of scaly patches    but then again it is possible those patches will clear up on their own without applying anything at all to them wishing you well
lumps in both breasts  i am a 15 year old female kind of immature body wise for my age but i have lumps the same size in both breasts ifwhen somebody bumps into me and accidentally hits my breast it is very painful the lumps seem to not be connected in any way to the nipple however they seem to be fairly large i know breast cancer is practically impossible for someone my age but what could it possibly be  thank you,you may have breast cysts or your normal breast tissue is reacting to hormonal changes during your cycle either way it is important that you have your breasts properly examined you can see your primary care medical provider or ask to see a gynecologist you are correct that 15 year olds would not likely have breast cancer so the most logical explanation would be benign cysts or fibrocystic breast lumps but this cannot be conclusively determined blindly over the internet
should young athletes be screened for heart conditions,pre participation sports evaluations are a hot topic 鈥 despite the growing data in support of testing we still have not collectively agreed on the best way to screen young people many are familiar with the italian experience of screening all young athletes with electrocardiograms 鈥 this practice has diagnosed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and other conditions and likely has prevented many deaths but a limitation of screening many people for less common conditions is that some people without underlying heart conditions may have abnormal electrocardiograms leading to more expensive testing and given limited resources we unfortunately must consider both benefit and cost some have argued that sudden death from undiagnosed cardiac conditions is so uncommon that we frankly can not afford to screen everyone but recent research may suggest that screening with electrocardiograms may be cost effective according to commonly accepted thresholds one of my good friends from cardiology fellowship euan ashley who heads the stanford hypertrophic cardiomyopathy center recently published an article which directly addresses the question of whether screening athletes with electrocardiograms in addition to a medical history and physical exam is cost effective as compared to a history and physical alone cost effectiveness is typically judged in terms of cost per life year saved euan and his team found that adding electrocardiograms to a screening program saved approximately 2 1 life years per 1000 people tested at an additional cost of about 89 dollars per athlete this suggests a cost effectiveness ratio of about 43 000 per life year saved in general procedures are felt to be cost effective if they cost less than 50 000 per life year saved to give some perspective hemodialysis for end stage kidney disease has a ratio that falls in the range of approximately 50 000 scientific data can guide us but it does not help balance our budgets while we might find that a given procedure treatment or screening test may be cost effective by standard definitions that still does not mean that we have the money to do it and it is unlikely that we will stop paying for previously accepted procedures in favor of others that may be cheaper electrocardiograms and kidney dialysis are apples and oranges but the data does raise questions moving forward given limited resources who should be entitled to potentially life saving cardiac screening the nfl nba and increasingly mls have access to some of the best medical care around it is my hope that if we get our act together with regards to screening our professional athletes appropriately than perhaps we can focus the conversation on our sons and daughters who i would love to see screened on a more consistent basis in the future

is it better to apply heat or cold to sore muscles after stenuous exercise,most helpful answer everything i have read says cold if there is tissue damage the cold constricts blood flow which reduces spread of cellular components which can cause rupture of nearby cells making the injury worse and longer to heal heat is not usually applied to an injury until 72 hours have passed this is to increase circulation and promote healing more recent research shows movement of skeletal muscles produces hormone like substances that promote and speed healing of damaged or inflamed tissues throughout the body so if you can move do lastly a small meal of four parts carbs and one part protein within 90 minutes of exercise will help speed muscle recovery the body will use that energy and protein to quickly try to re construct those damaged tissues this information is from exercise physiology ice is typically among the first thing to do in the recovery process after strenuous exercise icing your muscles helps to reduce pain and decrease swelling and inflammation ice causes your blood vessels to narrow which will reduce your blood flow to the muscle or injured area never place ice directly on your skin however wrap an ice pack around a thin cloth and place on the affected muscle for ten minutes at a time you can use ice multiple times per day for a few days after exercise but make sure to allow for your skin to return to room temperature before icing after each 10 minute interval heat is typically applied to uscles or injuries that do not have swelling or inflammation heat will cause your blood vessels to expand which improves circulation and allows more blood to go to the affected area heat can be useful for chronic injuries and muscle soreness or it can be used before exercise to stimulate blood flow and help prepare the muscle for exercise heat should also not be directly applied to skin and should be used for short 10 15 minute intervals always check with your doctor before starting treatment of an injury especially if the condition worsens or fails to improve within the first few days of an injury ice can help the process of healing applying ice to injured tissue can cause blood vessels to shrink and this makes them less capable of releasing chemicals that lead to swelling inflammation and pain after a few days it probably best to apply heat to sore muscles this makes muscle spasms less likely and relaxes injured muscles however because the events behind every injury are different speak with your doctor first i have just spent the last 6 weeks in physical therapy they always apply heat or have me get on a bike to heat up my muscles for 15 minutes before i go through any table massage work next i do all my exercises then they end the session with 10 minutes of ice somtimes what contributes to soreness is 1 lack of warm up so insuffcicient oxygen was available to fuel

red wine lowering blood sugar level hi  i have type 2 diabetes last few years i am using metformin 2+2 tablets i noticed that red wine is very good for lowering blood sugar yesterday after supper i had 2 glasses of red wine and before going to bed i had only 3 8 sugar in my blood i understand that doctors do not want to say that alcohol is good but red wine for me glass or two is very good i did not try and prove with other alcohols but i can suggest 2 glasses of red wine a day regards zoran markanovic dartmouth ns canada,only one study has shown that red wine can potentially benefit people with type 2 diabetes so there seems to be no reason why you cannot have a glass or two per day assuming you are on your medication following an otherwise good diabetic diet and check your blood sugars regularly cheers

could i still have lyme disease  i was diagnosed 4 yrs ago i never found a tick bite so i am not sure how long i had it before i started antibiotics i have never felt the same i am still just as tired and constantly achy in my neck and back i get terrible headaches that last days i get sharp pains in my arms all the time i randomly get dizzy and i have fainted a several times a year ago someone said it is allergies so i tried allergy medicines and just got sicker in sept i had mono i am 18 and i still feel like i am dying,based upon my personal experience along with my husband daughter and now hundreds of people that i have come to know through a variety of venues i am a professional counselor with 30 years of experience  your symptoms can absolutely be attributed to persistent borrelia lyme infection  and perhaps coinfections i strongly recommend you review the international lyme and associated diseases ilads website for up to date and accurate information because of what comes down to what is now willful ignorance many doctors are poiltical hacks rather than physicians  like the expert who gave you horrible advice on this forum
my right tonsil is severely infected and is getting more swollen and infected with keflex medicine what should i do  i have had a problem with getting tonsillitis over the past couple years but i mainly get it it on the left side however this time it is the right one that is infected i have been taking keflex for it for about 4 days and since that it has gotten more swollen and now completely covered in white puss and infection should i go to another clinic or hospital is there anything they can do since i am already on medicine,this could be a peritonsillar abscess one sided severe tonsillar swelling is the primary sign of this potentially serious problem since i can not see it my advice would be to seek medical care as soon as you can you need to be re examined unless your doctor specifically tested you for strep before prescribing the keflex failure to respond or even worse on antibiotics could indicate that you have mononucleosis mono so this should be considered when you are seen today

is it safe to allow a tennager who has cerebral palsy to play basketball  i coach a basketball team for high school aged kids and one of my players has cerebral palsy he played on the team last year but we were very concerned about his condition and his safety but his parents seemed to have no problem with him playing my coaching staff and i were very concerned about how safe it would be to allow him to play again this year as last yer he could not stay on the court very long without looking very exhausted is it safe to continue to let him play,cerebral palsy can be so variable that without knowing the details of his particular cp involvement it would not be possible for me to offer you a specific answer but generally a teenager with cp can play sports i admire you for being concerned and cooperative it was be best for his medical provider to sign a medical clearance    someone who knows his case many kids with cp perhaps because of the muscle involvement with this disorder may become more fatigued if he has some underlying respiratory or cardiac problem then this will need to be evaluated by his medical provider before clearing him for sports participation kids with cp should be supported and encourage to do many activities so if he can make the team i do not think you will need to worry about his safety any more than the other kids

why does a patient with heart disease retain fluid,heart failure is the result of poor cardiac function and is reflected by a decreased volume of blood pumped out by the heart called cardiac output heart failure can be caused by weakness of the heart muscle which pumps blood out through the arteries to the entire body or by dysfunction of the heart valves which regulate the flow of blood between the chambers of the heart the diminished volume of blood pumped out by the heart decreased cardiac output is responsible for a decreased flow of blood to the kidneys as a result the kidneys sense that there is a reduction of the blood volume in the body to counter the seeming loss of fluid the kidneys retain salt and water in this instance the kidneys are fooled into thinking that the body needs to retain more fluid volume when in fact the body already is holding too much fluid this fluid increase ultimately results in the buildup of fluid within the lungs which causes shortness of breath because of the decreased volume of blood pumped out by the heart decreased cardiac output the volume of blood in the arteries is also decreased despite the actual increase in the body is total fluid volume an associated increase in the amount of fluid in the blood vessels of the lungs causes shortness of breath because the excess fluid from the lungs blood vessels leaks into the airspaces alveoli and interstitium in the lungs this accumulation of fluid in the lung is called pulmonary edema at the same time accumulation of fluid in the legs causes pitting edema this edema occurs because the build up of blood in the veins of the legs causes leakage of fluid from the legs capillaries tiny blood vessels into the interstitial spaces an understanding of how the heart and lungs interact will help you to better comprehend how fluid retention works in heart failure the heart has four chambers an auricle and a ventricle on the left side of the heart and an auricle and ventricle on the right the left auricle receives oxygenated blood from the lungs and transfers it to the left ventricle which then pumps it through the arteries to the entire body the blood then is transported back to the heart by veins into the right auricle and transferred to the right ventricle which then pumps it to the lungs for re oxygenation left sided heart failure which is due primarily to a weak left ventricle usually is caused by coronary artery disease hypertension or disease of the heart valves typically when these patients initially come to the doctor they are troubled by shortness of breath with exertion and when lying down at night orthopnea these symptoms are due to pulmonary edema that is caused by pooling of the blood in the vessels of the lungs in contrast right sided heart failure which often is due to chronic lung diseases such as emphysema initially causes salt retention and edema persistent salt
